[8/19/16, 3:06:03 PM] Akshay: Some of my classes have only 10 min in between
[8/19/16, 3:06:14 PM] Rahul: I have 17 hrs a week
[8/19/16, 3:06:19 PM] Akshay: So that's fine on a small-medium campus like rice
[8/19/16, 3:06:35 PM] Akshay: But on a huge OS campus...üòÉ... Walking?
[8/19/16, 3:07:00 PM] Akshay: Yes I will have 18.

The last one hr is a 1 credit recommended course for spatial visualization
[8/19/16, 3:07:01 PM] Rahul: No man all the eng and science bld r close to each other in one part of campus
[8/19/16, 3:07:16 PM] Akshay: Three hrs a week class for that, but only 1 creditüòÉ
[8/19/16, 3:07:16 PM] Rahul: Ah ok I didn't have to do that
[8/19/16, 3:07:33 PM] Akshay: It's because I guess I didn't get above 70% on the spatial visualization test
[8/19/16, 3:07:52 PM] Akshay: Ok all the relevant bldgs are close to each other
[8/19/16, 3:07:56 PM] Akshay: That's what I meant
[8/19/16, 3:07:57 PM] Akshay: !
[8/19/16, 3:08:00 PM] Akshay: So that's fine
[8/19/16, 3:08:06 PM] Akshay: I'll ttyl
[8/19/16, 3:08:12 PM] Rahul: I got 22/30 but apparently that's very good
[8/19/16, 3:08:17 PM] Akshay: Nice
[8/19/16, 3:08:34 PM] Akshay: Lol this probably should have been a private chat :")
[8/20/16, 12:07:52 AM] Udit: Cul
[8/20/16, 6:56:06 AM] Rahul: I am conc yo Dubai on Dec 17 and leaving on Jan 5
[8/20/16, 6:57:14 AM] Akshay: I'll be coming on 15th and leaving on Jan 7 mostly
(The Jan trip is not confirmed)
[8/20/16, 6:57:38 AM] Rahul: Ah ok
[8/20/16, 6:57:48 AM] Rahul: Thankfully I am coming Emirates only
[8/20/16, 6:58:22 AM] Rahul: Air France was very good though but just safety concern in Paris airport
[8/20/16, 6:59:05 AM] Akshay: Alright
[8/20/16, 6:59:14 AM] Suyash: Air France was almost as good as Emirates IMO, just the movies were meh
[8/20/16, 6:59:22 AM] Suyash: Nice food
[8/20/16, 6:59:42 AM] Suyash: CDG airport also nice, better than anything in US :")
[8/20/16, 6:59:46 AM] Akshay: For Dec I am coming by Emirates (return leg of my flight to Houston) 
But for Jan, my parents are considering other options
[8/20/16, 7:02:21 AM] Rahul: Nice but in air France the seats were at 45 degree angles to the length of the plane !
[8/20/16, 7:02:48 AM] Rahul: Just buy the tickets with miles
[8/20/16, 7:03:00 AM] Akshay: Hahaha rahul
[8/20/16, 7:03:07 AM] Suyash: Lol I was in economy
[8/20/16, 7:03:12 AM] Rahul: Like u get business for 100K miles plus little cash
[8/20/16, 7:03:15 AM] Suyash: There was decent space, leather seat
[8/20/16, 7:03:27 AM] Suyash: That is enough to please me!
[8/20/16, 7:30:10 AM] Akshay: Lolol for me, leg space & good entertainment are enough, but unfortunately the former is usually much compromised in economy
[8/20/16, 7:30:38 AM] Akshay: This time it was decent in Emirates. Not too much to complain, but probably I was distracted by watching movies
[8/20/16, 8:27:45 AM] Udit: I hv same expectations from a plane
[8/20/16, 8:27:49 AM] Udit: :"")
[8/20/16, 8:28:41 AM] Udit: But usually emiratea to india is shit
[8/20/16, 9:14:36 AM] Sunil: I'm coming back by Emirates on December 17th
[8/20/16, 9:14:52 AM] Sunil: Not sure about the return trip
[8/20/16, 9:15:25 AM] Udit: Illl be coming on the same day
[8/20/16, 9:15:30 AM] Udit: üòäüòäüòä
[8/20/16, 9:15:33 AM] Sunil: Nice
[8/20/16, 9:19:12 AM] Rahul: U coming from JFK or direct Texas
[8/20/16, 9:22:54 AM] Sunil: From dfw
[8/20/16, 2:27:50 PM] Rahul: Oh ok
[8/21/16, 4:06:10 PM] Rahul: We made an FTT table in my dorm
[8/21/16, 4:06:26 PM] Akshay: Woah carrying the legacy to OS
[8/21/16, 4:06:38 PM] Akshay: In 20 yrs it'll become a D1 varsity sport
[8/21/16, 4:06:48 PM] Akshay: In 50 years an Olympic game
[8/21/16, 4:07:03 PM] Akshay: Lol send pics first
[8/21/16, 4:38:10 PM] Rahul: Mah I'm in Hilton now
[8/21/16, 4:38:41 PM] Rahul: But it's much more fun bcos the shape of the table is round
[8/21/16, 4:58:45 PM] Akshay: Lolol what is this FTT 360?
[8/21/16, 5:31:20 PM] Rahul: I guess
[8/21/16, 9:00:40 PM] Suyash: Woah
[8/22/16, 12:12:03 AM] Udit: Ftt?
[8/22/16, 12:12:09 AM] Udit: Wait
[8/22/16, 12:12:24 AM] Udit: That class tt
[8/22/16, 12:12:28 AM] Udit: ?
[8/22/16, 12:12:30 AM] Udit: üòÇ
[8/22/16, 12:12:31 AM] Udit: üëç
[8/22/16, 8:22:20 AM] Akshay: I went for chem and physics
[8/22/16, 8:22:20 AM] Akshay: The teacher had written in owlspace
[8/22/16, 8:22:20 AM] Akshay: Actually I'm supposed to be having sociology from 10-10:50 but today it's not there
[8/22/16, 8:22:21 AM] Akshay: Which is a portal like GLG
[8/22/16, 8:22:21 AM] Akshay: The physics class was big, 200+ ppl
[8/22/16, 8:22:21 AM] Akshay: What's struck me is that there will be a lot of work
[8/22/16, 8:22:22 AM] Akshay: In Indian system also there was work, but mainly self study
[8/22/16, 8:22:22 AM] Akshay: Here it's the same or probably easier concepts, but they are complicating everything with three types of homework, too much assistance, office hours, group discussion etc
[8/22/16, 8:22:22 AM] Akshay: It's essentially the same thing, but in my opinion, this way it's more laborious
[8/22/16, 8:22:23 AM] Akshay: The textbook for example, instead of just telling you to do Page 50, all questions
[8/22/16, 8:22:23 AM] Akshay: There is an online homework portal called Webassign
[8/22/16, 8:22:23 AM] Akshay: For which the code comes with the textbook when you buy
[8/22/16, 8:22:24 AM] Akshay: In that there is regular hw which you can take help, use books etc, untimed
There is something called Pledged problems, timed, any class resources (not internet) can be used, but no discussion/help
[8/22/16, 8:22:24 AM] Akshay: Then there are tests of 90 min twice a semester
[8/22/16, 8:22:24 AM] Akshay: One final exam of 3 hrs
[8/22/16, 8:22:24 AM] Akshay: There are credit points for lab work, class participation
[8/22/16, 8:22:24 AM] Akshay: There is also a compulsory small group discussion which is an attached course
[8/22/16, 8:22:25 AM] Akshay: Ffs
[8/23/16, 5:23:56 PM] Rahul: Haha dude I just did wipeout for welcome week yesterday
[8/23/16, 5:24:33 PM] Akshay: What
[8/23/16, 5:25:00 PM] Rahul: Like the obstacle course they had a mini one in the Olympic size pool
[8/23/16, 5:25:50 PM] Akshay: Still didn't understand
[8/23/16, 5:25:55 PM] Akshay: Lol sorry
[8/23/16, 5:26:40 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/23/16, 5:27:12 PM] Rahul: From the side ppl throwing balls and spraying water and stuff
[8/23/16, 5:27:18 PM] Akshay: Ok
[8/23/16, 5:27:21 PM] Akshay: Woah nice
[8/23/16, 5:27:26 PM] Akshay: Was this an orientation activity
[8/23/16, 5:27:48 PM] Rahul: No for welcome week not part of orientation it was optional
[8/23/16, 5:28:12 PM] Akshay: Alright
[8/23/16, 5:28:29 PM] Akshay: OS seems huge in every aspect
[8/23/16, 5:28:39 PM] Akshay: It may be one of the best unis in athletics overall
[8/23/16, 5:28:57 PM] Akshay: Like I was telling suyash-ucla is also epic, probably the best in US in athletics D1
[8/23/16, 5:34:38 PM] Sunil: I'll be moving into the dorm tomorrow
[8/23/16, 5:34:56 PM] Akshay: Haha all the best with the unpacking
[8/23/16, 5:35:02 PM] Akshay: Did you buy everything needed
[8/23/16, 5:35:16 PM] Sunil: Yeah bought them today
[8/23/16, 5:35:35 PM] Akshay: Nice

[8/23/16, 5:36:36 PM] Sunil: Oh
[8/23/16, 5:36:50 PM] Akshay: But as such the chemistry 121 syllabus is damn easy
[8/23/16, 5:36:58 PM] Akshay: As in, not easy because of the content itself
[8/23/16, 5:37:04 PM] Akshay: But easy because we have done in school
[8/23/16, 5:37:08 PM] Akshay: The same stuff
[8/23/16, 5:37:13 PM] Sunil: Okay
[8/23/16, 5:37:27 PM] Sunil: My first class is chem lab
[8/23/16, 5:37:38 PM] Sunil: Day after tomorrow
[8/23/16, 5:37:48 PM] Akshay: Nice

[8/27/16, 12:55:40 PM] Akshay: One of the bioethics courses
[8/27/16, 12:55:43 PM] Udit: üò≥üò≥
[8/27/16, 12:56:19 PM] Akshay: BIO 565- Ethical Concepts in Surrogacy and Sperm Donation
[8/27/16, 12:56:20 PM] Akshay: Lol
[8/27/16, 12:56:27 PM] Akshay: I think it's a graduate course
[8/27/16, 12:56:48 PM] Rahul: I won't do obviously
[8/27/16, 12:57:13 PM] Rahul: Not even plasma it's supposed to be very dehydrating
[8/27/16, 12:57:43 PM] Rahul: But if someone is desperate for money , they can make 8000 plus dollars a year !
[8/27/16, 12:59:11 PM] Akshay: Yes
[8/27/16, 12:59:16 PM] Rahul: That would almost take them above he poverty line
[8/27/16, 1:00:02 PM] Rahul: It just goes to show why most ppl who beg for money and stuff don't deserve it
[8/27/16, 1:01:01 PM] Akshay: Woah chill
[8/27/16, 1:01:10 PM] Akshay: Blood donation many ppl do though
[8/27/16, 1:01:27 PM] Akshay: It's not an unhealthy process as such, if you are a healthy and well-nourished person
[8/27/16, 1:02:53 PM] Akshay: See the thing is, anyway, our body makes so many blood cells a day
[8/27/16, 1:03:09 PM] Akshay: Probably they'll make you increase water and food consumption for a week after the donation
[8/27/16, 1:05:15 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/27/16, 1:05:15 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/27/16, 1:05:44 PM] Akshay: Woah
[8/27/16, 1:06:01 PM] Akshay: Is it just plasma, or is it general blood donation?
[8/27/16, 1:06:19 PM] Rahul: Plasma

[9/3/16, 8:54:45 AM] Suyash: Wow
[9/3/16, 8:54:54 AM] Suyash: Are you inside the stadium?
[9/3/16, 8:55:05 AM] Rahul: I am going there
[9/3/16, 8:55:10 AM] Rahul: Game starts at 12
[9/3/16, 8:55:25 AM] Suyash: OSU vs. ?
[9/3/16, 8:55:25 AM] Rahul: My dorm is only 5 mins away though
[9/3/16, 8:55:30 AM] Suyash: Great
[9/3/16, 8:55:33 AM] Rahul: Bowling green
[9/3/16, 8:55:41 AM] Suyash: What is that?
[9/3/16, 8:55:45 AM] Akshay: Haha enjoy
[9/3/16, 8:55:48 AM] Rahul: Another uni
[9/3/16, 8:55:50 AM] Rahul: Thnx
[9/3/16, 8:56:07 AM] Akshay: Mid week, I think Tuesday, I watched a women's volleyball game. Rice beat Houston Baptist uni
[9/3/16, 8:56:17 AM] Rahul: OSU is 6th in pre season rankings so football is too crazy here
[9/3/16, 8:56:31 AM] Rahul: We won national championship in 2014
[9/3/16, 8:56:56 AM] Akshay: Rahul's really getting into the OS community
[9/3/16, 8:57:01 AM] Akshay: "We won..."
[9/3/16, 8:57:21 AM] Rahul: Ya dude been here for 2 weeks
[9/3/16, 8:57:21 AM] Akshay: What did you do, rahul, wanker
[9/3/16, 8:57:31 AM] Akshay: THEY won it
[9/3/16, 8:57:40 AM] Akshay: You sat in jumeirah and chilled
[9/3/16, 8:57:50 AM] Akshay: Lol jk I understand what you mean
[9/3/16, 8:58:14 AM] Rahul: Wat did I do when India won  t20 World Cup for that matterüòä
[9/3/16, 8:58:31 AM] Akshay: Atleast you may have watched it...
[9/3/16, 8:59:28 AM] Rahul: Ok baba I admit defeat
[9/3/16, 8:59:47 AM] Suyash: Which league is OSU in?
[9/3/16, 8:59:49 AM] Suyash: NCAA?
[9/3/16, 8:59:54 AM] Rahul: Yup
[9/3/16, 8:59:59 AM] Akshay: Yeah div 1, big ten conference
[9/3/16, 9:00:05 AM] Rahul: Yes
[9/3/16, 9:00:41 AM] Suyash: I heard UCLA is also in NCAA, but 16th pre-season - so idk if they're playing the same league
[9/3/16, 9:00:47 AM] Akshay: Ncaa is not the league, ncaa is the governing body of college athletics.
They govern three divisions 1,2,3- each division has groups.
Rice is D1, in the group called Conference USA
[9/3/16, 9:01:01 AM] Suyash: Ah okay
[9/3/16, 9:01:05 AM] Akshay: OSU is in D1, Big ten conference
[9/3/16, 9:01:12 AM] Akshay: Which includes UIUC, Umich et al
[9/3/16, 9:01:18 AM] Suyash: Both in D1?
[9/3/16, 9:01:25 AM] Suyash: But different conference?
[9/3/16, 9:01:34 AM] Akshay: UCLA is also D1-I think it's called the Pacific conference, along with Stanford, USC et al
[9/3/16, 9:01:37 AM] Rahul: Michigan vs OSU going to be sweet
[9/3/16, 9:01:45 AM] Akshay: Yeah the conference is based on the location
[9/3/16, 9:01:53 AM] Rahul: Ok I need to leave bye
[9/3/16, 9:01:59 AM] Akshay: While being in D1 is dictated by quality
[9/3/16, 9:02:03 AM] Suyash: Bye have fun
[9/3/16, 9:02:06 AM] Akshay: Bye
[9/3/16, 9:02:21 AM] Suyash: Here USC vs. UCLA is the biggest event of entire year I guess
[9/3/16, 9:02:33 AM] Suyash: But to get tickets, you must buy a season pass
[9/3/16, 9:02:50 AM] Akshay: Oh
[9/3/16, 9:02:54 AM] Akshay: Even for students?
[9/3/16, 9:02:59 AM] Suyash: Other games - like vs. Stanford - which I want to attend, I can get individual tickets
[9/3/16, 9:03:00 AM] Suyash: Yes
[9/3/16, 9:03:02 AM] Suyash: It's not free
[9/3/16, 9:03:18 AM] Akshay: Ok. I think at Rice they don't have anyone to attend lol
[9/3/16, 9:03:24 AM] Akshay: So they put it up free
[9/3/16, 9:03:25 AM] Suyash: It costs 150 USD I think for a full season
[9/3/16, 9:03:26 AM] Suyash: Lol
[9/3/16, 9:03:35 AM] Suyash: Perks of a small private school
[9/3/16, 9:03:42 AM] Akshay: The college which has largest attendance at a game gets a treat at the end of the week
[9/3/16, 9:03:46 AM] Akshay: Usually a big meal or so
[9/3/16, 9:03:48 AM] Akshay: Lol
[9/3/16, 9:04:54 AM] Suyash: I checked, there is a Rice vs Stanford game this season :")
[9/3/16, 9:05:03 AM] Akshay: Hahaa
[9/3/16, 9:05:04 AM] Suyash: Which team will you support !
[9/3/16, 9:05:10 AM] Akshay: Rice shall get thrashed
[9/3/16, 9:05:17 AM] Akshay: I think I'll support RICE lol
[9/3/16, 9:05:27 AM] Akshay: Continuing the underdog spirit
[9/3/16, 9:05:32 AM] Suyash: Yup
[9/3/16, 9:05:38 AM] Suyash: There is also UCB vs. UCLA
[9/3/16, 9:05:50 AM] Suyash: I'll want to watch that
[9/3/16, 9:06:19 AM] Akshay: UCB is probably the best at swimming I've heard
[9/3/16, 9:06:33 AM] Akshay: Tennis et al, every uni comes after Ucla and USC
[9/3/16, 9:07:07 AM] Suyash: Yes, Stanford swimmers are busy committing particular type of crime
[9/3/16, 9:07:16 AM] Akshay: Savage
[9/3/16, 9:09:16 AM] Udit: Wow
[9/3/16, 9:09:20 AM] Udit: Guys enjoy
[9/3/16, 9:09:24 AM] Udit: :"")
[9/3/16, 5:43:46 PM] Rahul: We won like 77-10
[9/3/16, 5:44:08 PM] Rahul: It's actually not TOO hard to keep up with ways goin on
[9/3/16, 5:46:35 PM] Rahul: Winsipedia says OSU vs UCLA is 4 all in football but I doubt it's up to date
[9/3/16, 5:47:06 PM] Rahul: 3-2 losing vs Stanford
[9/3/16, 7:46:46 PM] Akshay: Woah
[9/5/16, 8:51:41 AM] Udit: Gud game Suyash
[9/5/16, 8:51:46 AM] Udit: :"")
[9/5/16, 9:01:49 AM] Suyash: Yes, very interesting today!
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: A new game was created, that is actually quite fun
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: It's normal squash, with different scoring
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: Whoever wins the point, can choose to either add one to his total, or deduct one from opponents
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: And it's first to reach 11
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: Or whoever reaches -11 loses
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: The fun part is that this game takes ages to get over
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: But stays interesting unlike a 5 setter that may have one sided games
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: And also needs some strategy
[9/5/16, 9:06:37 AM] Suyash: Udit was 9-1 up, I brought it back to 0-0. Then I was 7-3 up, back to 1-1 or something. Then he went ahead and finally I got back to win 11-5
[9/5/16, 9:07:16 AM] Udit: Ya that was fun
[9/5/16, 9:07:25 AM] Udit: I just came back
[9/5/16, 9:07:32 AM] Udit: üòìüòì
[9/7/16, 5:33:02 PM] Rahul: Is anyone else feeling weirdly nostalgic today suddenly
[9/7/16, 5:43:05 PM] Akshay: No but it had happened to me
[9/7/16, 5:43:20 PM] Akshay: Nostalgia for what/about what
[9/7/16, 5:49:20 PM] Rahul: Like missing Skool / ECPL
[9/7/16, 5:49:33 PM] Rahul: / Dubai
[9/7/16, 5:50:23 PM] Sunil: I can relate to it
[9/7/16, 5:50:49 PM] Rahul: Yah I just wish it was still 8th grade lol
[9/7/16, 5:51:16 PM] Rahul: No worries except which ECPL game was scheduled next day
[9/7/16, 5:52:11 PM] Rahul: Remembering the old days .....
[9/7/16, 5:53:49 PM] Rahul: It suddenly seems like only yesterday we were arguing whether fouls should be included in the basketball game in PE
[9/7/16, 6:02:21 PM] Sunil: True
[9/7/16, 6:35:59 PM] Rahul: Dude it's barely the end of the second week here they want us to "build a DC power supply and use an oscilloscope to determine waveforms "
[9/7/16, 6:36:16 PM] Rahul: In tomorrow's lab
[9/7/16, 7:19:25 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/7/16, 7:47:12 PM] Akshay: Lolol
[9/7/16, 7:47:23 PM] Akshay: In physics lab today, we used this software called loggerpro
[9/7/16, 7:47:33 PM] Akshay: Basically it analyses motion in a video
[9/7/16, 7:47:47 PM] Rahul: Yes I did that to
[9/7/16, 7:47:57 PM] Akshay: So we were made to move a cart on a table in different ways, get video of that, and plot graphs etc
[9/7/16, 7:47:59 PM] Akshay: Wait guys
[9/7/16, 7:48:04 PM] Akshay: Another huge thing
[9/7/16, 7:48:18 PM] Rahul: And then it also gives the a v X graphs yah
[9/7/16, 7:48:26 PM] Akshay: In physics, if you EVER have a numerical or something you can't solve, first step GOOGLE
[9/7/16, 7:48:38 PM] Akshay: Essentially, all colleges have the same or similar sums and portion
[9/7/16, 7:48:45 PM] Akshay: The teachers aren't making them up
[9/7/16, 7:48:57 PM] Akshay: A lot of them are on commonly used online forums too
[9/7/16, 7:49:09 PM] Akshay: Yahoo answers etc
[9/7/16, 7:49:22 PM] Akshay: Because so many college students essentially struggle with similar sums
[9/7/16, 7:49:23 PM] Akshay: Lol
[9/7/16, 7:49:34 PM] Rahul: Ok
[9/7/16, 7:49:40 PM] Rahul: Wat was the lab u had
[9/7/16, 7:51:06 PM] Akshay: It was an experiment to move a cart, plot x vs t, then try to achieve constant motion using the hands to guide the cart/or pushing it and letting it go on its own
[9/7/16, 7:51:15 PM] Akshay: Plotting graphs, answering questions
[9/7/16, 7:51:18 PM] Akshay: It wasn't difficult
[9/7/16, 7:51:25 PM] Rahul: Oh ok
[9/7/16, 7:51:25 PM] Akshay: Just fucking boring and mundane
[9/7/16, 7:51:37 PM] Akshay: But for sure better than school chutiya optics
[9/7/16, 7:51:49 PM] Akshay: I met two Indian American guys, they were my lab partners
[9/7/16, 7:51:52 PM] Akshay: From Florida
[9/7/16, 7:53:18 PM] Rahul: We had to put the cart on a slope and call it " police car " , we had to raise one end so it was an 8 cm slope and then there was a robber car that was motorised - the cop car had to exactly catch the robber car after a specified horizontal distance
[9/7/16, 7:53:33 PM] Akshay: Ahh lolol chor police
[9/7/16, 7:53:45 PM] Rahul: Yah
[9/7/16, 7:53:56 PM] Rahul: The second 1 was slightly better though
[9/7/16, 7:54:31 PM] Rahul: Like we had to launch a ball of a table using a launcher and hit a moving target on the ground
[9/7/16, 7:54:51 PM] Akshay: In chem we did a reaction between sodium carbonate and hcl, to produce CO2 to make an "airbag"- essentially an experiment to learn about stoichiometry, moles et al
[9/7/16, 7:54:57 PM] Akshay: Reminds me, lab analysis due tomorrow
[9/7/16, 7:55:00 PM] Akshay: Ttyl
[9/7/16, 7:55:09 PM] Rahul: Ok bye
[9/7/16, 7:55:30 PM] Rahul: I am only taking chem next semester
[9/7/16, 7:57:10 PM] Rahul: Dudes guess Wat I came here and the only laptop more popular than Mac on this campus is dell xps 15
[9/7/16, 7:57:26 PM] Akshay: Lolol
[9/7/16, 7:57:30 PM] Rahul: Wat a chance
[9/7/16, 11:46:56 PM] Suyash: Rahul in Grade 8 reminds me to contemplate about where his dear companions Naveed Rizwan and Rayeed Rizwan Waghu will be going to Uni!
[9/7/16, 11:47:54 PM] Suyash: *Naweed
[9/8/16, 3:46:04 AM] Rahul: I think they probably r
[9/8/16, 4:31:42 AM] Akshay: They might be ivy, seriously
[9/8/16, 4:32:03 AM] Akshay: They went to one of the best schools in India, I'm pretty sure
[9/8/16, 4:32:09 AM] Akshay: Lol
[9/10/16, 3:03:42 AM] Suyash: Guys what all documents did y'all have to take for US immigration?
[9/10/16, 3:03:55 AM] Suyash: Other than passport, I-20
[9/10/16, 4:16:39 AM] Akshay: Keep the stuff you tool for visa app
[9/10/16, 4:16:45 AM] Akshay: It's a random process
[9/10/16, 4:17:24 AM] Akshay: As such the key stuff is I20 and passport, without those 100% you can't enter
[9/10/16, 4:17:38 AM] Akshay: Took*
[9/10/16, 4:54:57 AM] Suyash: Alright thanks
[9/10/16, 4:55:10 AM] Suyash: And what's this I-94 and SEVIS thing?
[9/10/16, 5:44:39 AM] Rahul: I 94 is a statement of ur arrival in US u have to print it outs free u arrive
[9/10/16, 5:45:53 AM] Rahul: SEVIS receipt is I think proof that u paid the online visa fee
[9/10/16, 5:47:35 AM] Rahul: * after u arrive
[9/10/16, 5:48:28 AM] Rahul: Bcos they made I94 electronic , u need to print it urself now from hotel
[9/10/16, 6:08:15 AM] Suyash: Ah so I only deal with I94 after I've gotten in
[9/10/16, 6:08:29 AM] Suyash: üëç
[9/10/16, 10:17:44 AM] Akshay: Sevis is the receipt of paying for the visa
[9/10/16, 10:17:56 AM] Akshay: I94 is something you access online after reaching US. Type in I 94 form on Google, go to the site that says US homeland security
[9/10/16, 10:17:56 AM] Akshay: They'll ask for passport number etc
[9/10/16, 10:17:56 AM] Akshay: Then you print out your most recent I94
[9/10/16, 10:18:31 AM] Rahul: Dude I just told that üëÜüèæ
[9/11/16, 3:18:44 AM] Udit: In Manchester!!
[9/11/16, 4:41:43 AM] Sunil: Nice üòÄ
[9/11/16, 4:57:00 AM] Suyash: Udit have you picked a side yet ;) Red or Blue?
[9/11/16, 8:55:13 AM] ‚ÄéUdit changed their phone number to a new number. Tap to message or add the new number.
[9/12/16, 6:05:10 AM] Suyash: Udit how's uni?
[9/12/16, 7:32:34 AM] Udit: Hey guys
[9/12/16, 7:32:39 AM] Udit: It's damn gud

[9/12/16, 9:12:15 AM] Sunil: Nice
[9/12/16, 9:17:27 AM] Akshay: Oh nice all the best udit
[9/12/16, 11:53:38 PM] Udit: Thnx man
[9/13/16, 10:02:45 PM] Akshay: The assistant tennis coach who is the residential associate on my floor
[9/13/16, 10:03:08 PM] Akshay: He hosts a study break every Tuesday night with some coffee, cinnamon rolls etc
[9/13/16, 10:03:14 PM] Akshay: I was chatting with him
[9/13/16, 10:03:42 PM] Akshay: Seems he beat somdev devvarman when they were both playing in college tennis
[9/13/16, 10:03:58 PM] Akshay: And he also lost in a third set tiebreaker vs Kevin Anderson
[9/13/16, 10:03:59 PM] Akshay: Wtf
[9/13/16, 10:04:21 PM] Akshay: All I could think of asking him was, how does it feel to return a 200+ kph serve
[9/13/16, 10:04:28 PM] Akshay: He said " it's pretty normal"
[9/13/16, 10:04:30 PM] Akshay: Lol
[9/14/16, 12:58:22 AM] Suyash: Woah
[9/14/16, 12:58:38 AM] Suyash: And he's "assistant"!
[9/14/16, 4:12:03 AM] Akshay: Hahaha
[9/14/16, 4:12:06 AM] Akshay: Yup
[9/14/16, 4:12:16 AM] Akshay: His name is bojan szumanski
[9/14/16, 5:02:14 AM] Suyash: I have caught up with Hrishikesh - who is confirmed not at Purdue, but IUPUI...
[9/14/16, 5:02:24 AM] Suyash: He has transformed into the typicL frat boy it seems
[9/14/16, 5:02:41 AM] Suyash: Unexpected for someone with humble roots in IHS üòÇ
[9/14/16, 5:03:07 AM] Sunil: Dude are you sure he's in iupui?
[9/14/16, 5:03:13 AM] Suyash: Yes
[9/14/16, 5:03:19 AM] Suyash: 100%
[9/14/16, 5:03:27 AM] Sunil: He kept lying to me till the very end
[9/14/16, 5:03:40 AM] Suyash: Yes we didn't get to know from him
[9/14/16, 5:03:44 AM] Suyash: He hasn't admitted yet
[9/14/16, 5:04:02 AM] Suyash: I asked Niraj, and his mom also confirmed
[9/14/16, 5:04:24 AM] Sunil: Okay
[9/14/16, 5:04:42 AM] Suyash: You can easily tell a frat boy apart - always in sleeveless shirt, weights in one hand, drinks in the other - that is the new Hrishi!
[9/14/16, 5:05:00 AM] Sunil: Wow what a transformation
[9/14/16, 5:05:10 AM] Suyash: Sunil how is uni going?
[9/14/16, 5:06:47 AM] Rahul: Are the wights lifting him or is he lifting the weights
[9/14/16, 5:07:07 AM] Suyash: Lol he has become buff!
[9/14/16, 5:07:22 AM] Rahul: O dam
[9/14/16, 5:08:42 AM] Rahul: Where is Niraj going
[9/14/16, 5:09:06 AM] Suyash: He is in Purdue
[9/14/16, 5:09:15 AM] Rahul: Cool
[9/14/16, 5:10:06 AM] Rahul: He is studying CS ?
[9/14/16, 5:12:04 AM] Rahul: I just hope most of these guys from Skool r there in Dubai in December
[9/14/16, 5:18:01 AM] Akshay: Yup
[9/14/16, 5:18:13 AM] Akshay: Just ran 7k, that's my frat!
[9/14/16, 5:18:27 AM] Akshay: Ttyl, good to see the US lads awake early
[9/14/16, 5:18:43 AM] Akshay: 8 am chem class, got to shower and eat, bye. Enjoy your day
[9/14/16, 5:25:08 AM] Suyash: 7k good going man!
[9/14/16, 5:25:40 AM] Udit: 7k!
[9/14/16, 5:25:40 AM] Udit: Whoa
[9/14/16, 5:25:53 AM] Suyash: I have one final night of 10+ hrs of sleep left, here in Dubai ;)
[9/14/16, 5:26:21 AM] Udit: I ran abt 4k
[9/14/16, 5:26:21 AM] Udit: üòìüòì
[9/14/16, 5:26:22 AM] Udit: üëèüëè
[9/14/16, 5:27:58 AM] Sunil: It's going good üëç
[9/14/16, 5:39:00 AM] Akshay: Dude udit 4k is pretty tough... It's good man. The improvement will soon be seen!
[9/14/16, 5:41:50 AM] Udit: Thnx man :"")
[9/14/16, 9:07:19 AM] Akshay: My classes today were pretty interesting
[9/14/16, 9:07:19 AM] Akshay: In chemistry, as a prelude to teaching Rutherford gold foil experiment, they made us throw tennis balls at a huge ball kept in the front of the class, and then analyse the similarities
[9/14/16, 9:07:19 AM] Akshay: In physics, while teaching projectile motion, the teacher did a demo of shooting a toy monkey kept on a long stand (with toy gun) to prove that you have to aim at the monkey
[9/14/16, 9:08:59 AM] Rahul: Nice for us in intro to programming they made us write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to explain to the reader how to play rock paper scissor
[9/14/16, 9:09:47 AM] Rahul: For physics she does a demo in every class at the beginning
[9/14/16, 9:10:15 AM] Akshay: Nice
[9/14/16, 9:10:54 AM] Akshay: Google Jason hafner. He's my physics prof. Said to be the best at Rice for intro stuff. Has a YouTube channel etc, makes everything really funny
[9/14/16, 9:29:06 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/14/16, 10:36:49 AM] Akshay: Yes!
[9/15/16, 4:14:47 PM] Akshay: Today I had a profound moment at dinner about 15 min ago
[9/15/16, 4:15:02 PM] Akshay: That completely made me realize that everything here is totally different from whatever I've known
[9/15/16, 4:15:11 PM] Akshay: So basically, a group of us was eating together
[9/15/16, 4:15:26 PM] Akshay: And we were insulting each other in jest
[9/15/16, 4:15:34 PM] Akshay: Making fun of funny habits et ak
[9/15/16, 4:15:36 PM] Akshay: Et al*
[9/15/16, 4:15:50 PM] Akshay: Bs, you know, just like we always do. Banter
[9/15/16, 4:16:16 PM] Akshay: One of my friends here, he started mimicking an Indian accent, in a hilarious way, said I spoke like that
[9/15/16, 4:16:23 PM] Akshay: No one was offended
[9/15/16, 4:16:28 PM] Akshay: Ofc it was all laughter
[9/15/16, 4:16:51 PM] Akshay: And then I responded, without thinking, I just called him a chutiya
[9/15/16, 4:17:06 PM] Udit: üëè
[9/15/16, 4:17:08 PM] Akshay: Everyone just went quiet
[9/15/16, 4:17:33 PM] Akshay: In that one moment I realised that none of the fuckers on the table knew anything about that word
[9/15/16, 4:17:48 PM] Akshay: While amongst old friends, us, it is a commonplace thing
[9/15/16, 4:18:14 PM] Akshay: So a small thing like language, made me realize that I'm in a place that's nothing like home
[9/15/16, 4:18:21 PM] Akshay: Now I'm suddenly feeling pretty homesick
[9/15/16, 4:18:35 PM] Akshay: Missing you'll, missing parents, missing Indian food
[9/15/16, 4:18:36 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[9/15/16, 4:25:24 PM] Rahul: Hahaha
[9/15/16, 4:25:46 PM] Rahul: U have the nostalgic shit too
[9/15/16, 4:25:57 PM] Rahul: I'm just having a bad bad cold
[9/15/16, 4:26:29 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/15/16, 4:29:19 PM] Akshay: I had a bad cold and cough over the wknd
[9/15/16, 4:29:47 PM] Akshay: Nah I'm not exactly nostalgic, I'm trying to not have time for any sentimental bs because that can screw you over pretty quick
[9/15/16, 4:29:48 PM] Rahul: Shit
[9/15/16, 4:30:01 PM] Akshay: I'm just now 100% aware that everything is different
[9/15/16, 4:30:09 PM] Akshay: It is sort of like an haha moment
[9/15/16, 4:30:21 PM] Akshay: A small event that makes you realize a big truth
[9/15/16, 4:32:01 PM] Rahul: Woah dude waxing philosophical
[9/15/16, 4:32:24 PM] Akshay: Lol no
[9/15/16, 4:32:51 PM] Akshay: Yesterday was also an uncomfortable sort of outcome of dinner
[9/15/16, 4:32:56 PM] Akshay: We were discussing uni et al
[9/15/16, 4:33:18 PM] Akshay: Out of 5 ppl at the table, 2 were saying "weren't you thrilled when rice accepted you"
[9/15/16, 4:33:31 PM] Akshay: 1 was saying, I got rejected by 8 unis, got 6
[9/15/16, 4:33:55 PM] Akshay: 1 was saying, he is happy, because he got Yale, but came to RICE because the music school here is way better
[9/15/16, 4:34:01 PM] Akshay: It is WAY better
[9/15/16, 4:34:15 PM] Akshay: Yale doesn't have a music school, only an unorganized department
[9/15/16, 4:34:24 PM] Akshay: Plus I think he got money here
[9/15/16, 4:34:29 PM] Akshay: And then it was my turn
[9/15/16, 4:34:52 PM] Akshay: And then I said, when rice accepted me,  that day I wasn't really extra happy or anything
[9/15/16, 4:35:05 PM] Rahul: Mistake
[9/15/16, 4:35:07 PM] Akshay: I knew I got a good uni, but that's it. No special reaction, because ivy was the aim
[9/15/16, 4:35:09 PM] Akshay: Lol
[9/15/16, 4:35:46 PM] Akshay: That discussion made me feel a bit sad about uni apps again. If not be a ledge, I should have just been at a better uni etc, those were my thoughts.
[9/15/16, 4:36:49 PM] Akshay: I think it's like 95% sure that none of us in this whatsapp group will become an absolute, other-wordly ledge yeah? We'll all hopefully be well off, solid jobs etc-but nothing exceptional, 1-in-a-million kind
[9/15/16, 4:38:36 PM] Rahul: Woah why do u say that
[9/15/16, 4:38:52 PM] Akshay: Because in the grand scheme of things, we are all very mediocre
[9/15/16, 4:39:09 PM] Akshay: Some ppl here are track and field athletes+double major
[9/15/16, 4:39:28 PM] Akshay: And even that, in the long run, might not lead to overwhelmingly epic success
[9/15/16, 4:39:43 PM] Akshay: I doubt I'll finish one major properly
[9/15/16, 4:39:54 PM] Rahul: Dude 95 percent of ledge ppl r nothing when they start
[9/15/16, 4:40:19 PM] Akshay: True... But only if they start üòú
[9/15/16, 4:40:33 PM] Rahul: So u can never say 1 of us won't
[9/15/16, 4:41:22 PM] Akshay: Okay, I shall speak for myself then (I privately guessed rahul would have the strongest opposition to my views, because we've discussed this a million times)
[9/15/16, 4:41:32 PM] Rahul: Yes
[9/15/16, 4:41:48 PM] Rahul: U can call me a chutiya :)
[9/15/16, 4:42:08 PM] Akshay: I personally feel I haven't started, and feel that 95% will never get the opportunity to start being a ledge. If the opportunity comes the ability will let me down, and vice-versa!!
[9/15/16, 4:42:33 PM] Rahul: Ok
[9/15/16, 4:42:48 PM] Akshay: This is obviously a pessimistic view
[9/15/16, 4:43:03 PM] Akshay: Good things, good luck can obviously happen to any of us
[9/15/16, 4:43:14 PM] Akshay: But I haven't factored that in yet
[9/15/16, 4:43:22 PM] Akshay: Going purely by past experiences
[9/15/16, 4:45:14 PM] Akshay: Leaving for club tennis now
[9/15/16, 4:45:46 PM] Akshay: Good to catch up with rahul on philosophical matters, I'm pretty sure suyash shall have an opinion to add when he wakes up!!
[9/15/16, 4:46:02 PM] Akshay: Udit and Sunil are usually pretty chilled about all this bs
[9/15/16, 4:46:17 PM] Akshay: In other news, Murray v del potro in the davis cup this wknd!
[9/16/16, 12:27:38 AM] Udit: Nah nothing like that
[9/16/16, 12:27:47 AM] Udit: Speaking about myself
[9/16/16, 12:28:04 AM] Udit: I am actually inspired by my dad
[9/16/16, 12:28:39 AM] Udit: He was just an aqua guard salesman
[9/16/16, 12:28:58 AM] Udit: And now he came here all by hard work and
[9/16/16, 12:29:11 AM] Udit: RISKS
[9/16/16, 12:29:17 AM] Udit: So
[9/16/16, 12:29:18 AM] Udit: To
[9/16/16, 12:30:05 AM] Udit: Be honest I think we all be smthing lyk 1 in a million in later years

[9/16/16, 2:52:43 AM] Udit: Enjoy
[9/16/16, 3:58:42 AM] Akshay: Well said udit!
[9/16/16, 3:59:44 AM] Akshay: Suyash, you should start revision of Lhospitals rule, differential equations etc etc on the plane itself :")
[9/16/16, 4:58:24 AM] Udit: I will miss that
[9/16/16, 6:55:21 AM] Rahul: Lol Suyash u can push away armrests and sleep
[9/16/16, 11:39:44 AM] Akshay: Ffs del Potro is getting too good
[9/16/16, 11:39:47 AM] Akshay: Which is good
[9/16/16, 11:39:56 AM] Akshay: But sort of seems to be too damn lucky now
[9/16/16, 11:40:13 AM] Akshay: Beats Murray in 5 set in 5hr 7 minutes at Davis cup
[9/16/16, 11:40:24 AM] Udit: Whoa
[9/16/16, 11:40:32 AM] Udit: Kya baat hai

[9/16/16, 11:45:50 AM] Sunil: Thanks man
[9/16/16, 11:45:52 AM] Akshay: I didn't know US unis had serious tt programs
[9/16/16, 11:45:56 AM] Akshay: Is it club tt?
[9/16/16, 11:46:24 AM] Akshay: Here at Rice, ping pong is like a mild after meal sport
[9/16/16, 11:46:34 AM] Akshay: Just to procrastinate a little :")
[9/16/16, 11:46:52 AM] Akshay: Every college has a table, plus obviously the recreation centre
[9/16/16, 12:23:50 PM] Akshay: Rice vs yale volleyball game going on now lol

[9/17/16, 9:47:24 AM] Akshay: Nice
[9/17/16, 9:49:44 AM] Akshay: Rahul, my sociology teacher mentioned some incident in Columbus, a 13 yr old kid shot by police or something like that
[9/17/16, 9:49:47 AM] Akshay: What's up

[9/17/16, 2:32:38 PM] Akshay: Udit ka optimism thoda zyada hote jaa raha hai... Control karo bhai! 
I think Sunil can process that hindi
[9/17/16, 2:32:59 PM] Udit: Ya
[9/17/16, 2:33:00 PM] Udit: No
[9/17/16, 2:45:50 PM] Sunil: Yea I can
[9/17/16, 2:56:00 PM] Akshay: Wow Sunil, congrats, your memory of ruchi khanna has served you well
[9/17/16, 3:24:42 PM] Rahul: Dude that just reminded me of that stupid poem we had to recite everytime she came to class
[9/17/16, 3:25:29 PM] Rahul: Wat is sociology again ?
[9/17/16, 9:20:18 PM] Suyash: I played squash today :)
[9/17/16, 9:20:48 PM] Suyash: There are 4 racketball courts and 2 racketball courts on the floor I was on - more above
[9/17/16, 9:21:11 PM] Suyash: I posted on group who wants to play - lol 3 Indian guys responded ASAP
[9/17/16, 9:21:26 PM] Suyash: *4 racketball and 2 squash
[9/17/16, 9:21:28 PM] Akshay: Damn
[9/17/16, 9:21:34 PM] Akshay: Were they any good
[9/17/16, 9:21:45 PM] Suyash: Yes
[9/17/16, 9:21:51 PM] Suyash: Today was problematic though
[9/17/16, 9:22:23 PM] Suyash: Because they didn't bring rackets, had to play with racketball ones borrowed from the centre
[9/17/16, 9:22:54 PM] Suyash: I did some self practice afterwards
[9/17/16, 9:23:06 PM] Akshay: But how good were they
[9/17/16, 9:23:19 PM] Suyash: Same level
[9/17/16, 9:23:24 PM] Suyash: Maybe better
[9/17/16, 9:23:27 PM] Akshay: Damn that's high
[9/17/16, 9:23:36 PM] Suyash: Not a totally next level
[9/17/16, 9:23:40 PM] Akshay: I went up to fourth floor of my college now
[9/17/16, 9:23:56 PM] Suyash: Today only 2 guys showed up, one more will next time - so idk
[9/17/16, 9:23:59 PM] Akshay: Mini "pregame" to a bigger party at another college
[9/17/16, 9:24:04 PM] Suyash: Ahh
[9/17/16, 9:24:24 PM] Suyash: Surprisingly no sight of booze yet here
[9/17/16, 9:24:40 PM] Suyash: Perhaps because everyone moving in just today - with parents :")
[9/17/16, 9:24:44 PM] Akshay: Then went to a friend's room to chill, because he hadn't gone to the party, he's abstaining from alcohol
[9/17/16, 9:24:55 PM] Suyash: Good :)
[9/17/16, 9:25:11 PM] Akshay: (Because of an incident last year, in which he had a drug-overdose-induced panic attack)
[9/17/16, 9:28:47 PM] Sunil: There's no squash in my uni
[9/17/16, 9:28:59 PM] Sunil: There's racquetball though
[9/17/16, 9:29:10 PM] Akshay: Is there no squash court at all?
[9/17/16, 9:29:23 PM] Sunil: No
[9/17/16, 9:29:55 PM] Akshay: Hmm
[9/17/16, 9:30:11 PM] Akshay: As long as there is tt, Sunil will stay alive :")
[9/17/16, 9:30:22 PM] Sunil: Lol
[9/17/16, 9:30:37 PM] Akshay: I think Sunil is probably offended by Americans tarnishing his beloved game with the silly name "ping pong"
[9/17/16, 9:30:46 PM] Sunil: I went and played tennis last week
[9/17/16, 9:30:50 PM] Akshay: He'd like it called table tennis
[9/17/16, 9:30:54 PM] Akshay: Woah Federer
[9/17/16, 9:31:43 PM] Akshay: Tbh Sunil's style of tennis is probably closer to Federer's than mine is!
[9/18/16, 9:11:21 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/18/16, 9:11:22 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/18/16, 9:11:27 AM] Akshay: Mtr food!
[9/18/16, 9:11:35 AM] Akshay: Pulao and dal
[9/18/16, 9:26:47 AM] Sunil: Nice
[9/18/16, 9:27:13 AM] Sunil: I was actually thinking about making dal tomorrow
[9/18/16, 9:27:23 AM] Akshay: Go for it today
[9/18/16, 9:27:24 AM] Akshay: Lol
[9/18/16, 9:27:41 AM] Suyash: You have a stove and stuff :0 ?
[9/18/16, 9:29:32 AM] Sunil: Akshay how's the food at your uni ?
[9/18/16, 9:38:01 AM] Akshay: Suyash, idiot, it's ready to eat MTR man
[9/18/16, 9:38:07 AM] Akshay: Just had to microwave it
[9/18/16, 9:38:29 AM] Akshay: It's good food, Sunil
[9/18/16, 9:38:38 AM] Akshay: Just gets boring because it's not to my taste
[9/18/16, 9:41:37 AM] Sunil: Same for me

[9/18/16, 10:04:20 AM] Suyash: When he said "making"
[9/18/16, 10:07:46 AM] Akshay: Ahh lol I see where you got confused
[9/18/16, 10:08:04 AM] Akshay: But even that's not a plausible confusion-did you think Sunil actually knows to cook? :")
[9/18/16, 10:10:44 AM] Sunil: I'm pretty sure all of us are equally bad at cooking üòÇ

[9/19/16, 5:20:30 PM] Suyash: Wow nice man
[9/19/16, 5:21:13 PM] Rahul: It seems comparable to Wat any other uni can offer
[9/19/16, 5:21:26 PM] Rahul: Like hundreds of companies
[9/19/16, 5:42:23 PM] Akshay: Wow enjoy
[9/19/16, 5:42:51 PM] Akshay: Rahul I thought all your focus in life from now is on successfully becoming a stock market genius
[9/19/16, 5:43:03 PM] Akshay: Eng jobs should be meh for you
[9/20/16, 7:00:35 PM] Suyash: I'm playing squash right now
[9/20/16, 7:00:47 PM] Suyash: The in house coach is a guy called Andrew Grant
[9/20/16, 7:00:59 PM] Suyash: He was PSA number 9 at his prime!
[9/20/16, 7:28:39 PM] Sunil: Oh damn
[9/20/16, 8:23:29 PM] Akshay: Damn so Ucla squash must be epic
[9/20/16, 8:23:45 PM] Akshay: Remember you thought there wouldn't be squash at Ucla
[9/21/16, 12:40:16 PM] Suyash: Yeah lol
[9/22/16, 2:16:34 PM] Akshay: Guys I hope I'm not getting squashed at uni
[9/22/16, 2:16:41 PM] Akshay: üòü I'm finding it weird
[9/22/16, 2:16:51 PM] Sunil: Y what happened
[9/22/16, 2:17:04 PM] Akshay: Today the ceve exam was an open notes exam,we could bring in one sheet of handwritten notes as references
[9/22/16, 2:17:28 PM] Akshay: It was not helpful at all and the questions were sort of tangential to the empirical fact that was taught
[9/22/16, 2:17:37 PM] Akshay: I can't judge how well I did
[9/22/16, 2:17:41 PM] Akshay: Ceve is civil eng
[9/22/16, 2:17:42 PM] Sunil: Oh
[9/22/16, 2:18:08 PM] Akshay: I also got back some problem sets in chemistry theory. Marks cut for reasons like "explain more" etc
[9/22/16, 2:18:08 PM] Akshay: Weird
[9/22/16, 2:18:08 PM] Akshay: I got 93/105 for the first lab.
26/36 and 33/43 for the first two problem sets. Total score of problem sets will have a 5% weightage in the final grade.
[9/22/16, 2:18:09 PM] Akshay: So that's no problem
[9/22/16, 2:18:09 PM] Akshay: But imagine if I lose lots of marks in the exam
[9/22/16, 2:18:09 PM] Akshay: I also saw that on the online portal, owlspace, my grade for the first two math homework sets are posted. I got 96% in both.
[9/22/16, 2:18:09 PM] Akshay: The math homework is basically an assortment of random sums from textbook decided by the professor, so I don't know how the scoring is done
[9/22/16, 2:18:10 PM] Akshay: Entire math homework for the semester will have a 40% weightage in the final grade
[9/22/16, 2:18:53 PM] Suyash: 96% is epic dude
[9/22/16, 2:19:09 PM] Akshay: Dude it was like 10-15 sums
[9/22/16, 2:19:17 PM] Akshay: Basically it means I got one sum wrong
[9/22/16, 2:19:41 PM] Suyash: My classes start tomorrow lol
[9/22/16, 2:19:39 PM] Akshay: I am not saying it's bad at all, but it would be nice to know how exactly the grading is done
[9/22/16, 2:19:57 PM] Suyash: Yesterday there was an engineering panel, gave talks / advice
[9/22/16, 2:19:55 PM] Akshay: Plus at uni, it seems people don't discuss answers frantically post exam
[9/22/16, 2:20:04 PM] Akshay: After ceve, I went to this kid in the exam
[9/22/16, 2:20:13 PM] Akshay: Asked him couple of numerical answers
[9/22/16, 2:20:17 PM] Suyash: One absolute ledge, said to bunk classes etc. And network
[9/22/16, 2:20:34 PM] Akshay: He was just speaking in general terms "very tricky exam" etc
[9/22/16, 2:20:50 PM] Akshay: He was almost offended by me wanting to know what actual answers he got
[9/22/16, 2:21:06 PM] Suyash: He did all that and got a research position with nobel prize winning physicist, loads of sick internships
[9/22/16, 2:21:25 PM] Suyash: Now a serial entrepreneur, sold a few startups, onto a new one involving AI
[9/22/16, 2:21:43 PM] Akshay: I was just asking whether he got the hydraulic radius as 1/4th the circle's diameter, but he wasn't aware even
[9/22/16, 2:21:45 PM] Akshay: Damn
[9/22/16, 2:21:57 PM] Suyash: Ah lemme guess you asked an Asian kid :")
[9/22/16, 2:21:57 PM] Akshay: I'm on a more mundane plane of thought right now!üòÉ
[9/22/16, 2:22:07 PM] Akshay: Nah, black
[9/22/16, 2:22:12 PM] Suyash: Ah
[9/22/16, 2:22:27 PM] Suyash: Here at UCLA, there are seriously very few Blacks
[9/22/16, 2:22:40 PM] Suyash: On my floor of 80 ppl, just 1
[9/22/16, 2:22:45 PM] Sunil: Wow
[9/22/16, 2:22:46 PM] Suyash: But too many Asians, Hispanics
[9/22/16, 2:23:03 PM] Sunil: At my uni it's mixed
[9/22/16, 2:23:19 PM] Akshay: Mine has a few
[9/22/16, 2:23:28 PM] Akshay: Also loads of Asians and whites
[9/22/16, 2:23:56 PM] Akshay: Surprisingly, extended discovery of more Indian/subcontinent origin Americans
[9/22/16, 2:24:08 PM] Suyash: Nice
[9/22/16, 2:24:28 PM] Suyash: Lol here they had an almost frat party hosted by the South Asian Society
[9/22/16, 2:24:35 PM] Suyash: Packed with Indians
[9/22/16, 2:24:54 PM] Suyash: Crowded, like India
[9/22/16, 2:25:01 PM] Suyash: But very few were international students
[9/22/16, 2:25:05 PM] Suyash: Most Americans
[9/22/16, 2:26:05 PM] Akshay: Ahh
[9/22/16, 2:26:14 PM] Akshay: I have chem mid term at 7
[9/22/16, 2:26:19 PM] Akshay: Had civil eng this afternoon
[9/22/16, 2:26:26 PM] Suyash: Woah mid term already
[9/22/16, 2:26:27 PM] Suyash: Damn
[9/22/16, 2:26:33 PM] Akshay: Next week Tuesday is physics and thursday math
[9/22/16, 2:26:47 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/22/16, 2:26:50 PM] Akshay: Yeah there are two midterms and one final in these four subjects
[9/22/16, 2:27:10 PM] Akshay: Chem and civil eng also have 2 tests in betw
[9/22/16, 2:27:12 PM] Akshay: Between
[9/22/16, 2:28:12 PM] Akshay: Dude suyash's brain seems to be slow rn :") I have been discussing my exam for the last 20 messages or so, suddenly he replies "woah midterm already"
[9/22/16, 2:28:53 PM] Suyash: Nah I thought it's a quiz
[9/22/16, 2:30:27 PM] Akshay: It was sort of a quiz, seemed formal like an exam though
[9/22/16, 2:30:43 PM] Akshay: No extra sheets etc given "write in the space provided only"
[9/22/16, 2:30:44 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[9/22/16, 2:30:56 PM] Sunil: I had chem mid term day before yesterday
[9/22/16, 2:31:00 PM] Sunil: Maths tomorrow
[9/22/16, 2:31:05 PM] Akshay: Woah Sunil how was it
[9/22/16, 2:31:31 PM] Sunil: Chem was okay
[9/22/16, 2:31:49 PM] Akshay: Ok hope it gets better soon as we adjust to the system of education
[9/22/16, 2:32:04 PM] Akshay: Sunil who are your friends
[9/22/16, 2:32:07 PM] Sunil: Yeah let's hope so
[9/22/16, 2:32:20 PM] Sunil: What do you mean
[9/22/16, 2:32:21 PM] Akshay: Indians mainly or other nationalities?
[9/22/16, 2:32:28 PM] Sunil: It's mixed
[9/22/16, 2:32:38 PM] Akshay: Ok
[9/22/16, 2:33:07 PM] Sunil: Uta is the fifth most diverse uni in us
[9/22/16, 2:33:25 PM] Akshay: Yes I have read that statistic
[9/22/16, 2:33:47 PM] Akshay: In the club tennis tournament when people from UTA came, I lost to a French guy
[9/22/16, 2:33:51 PM] Suyash: Nice
[9/22/16, 2:33:54 PM] Akshay: French-American dual
[9/22/16, 2:34:12 PM] Sunil: Oh
[9/22/16, 2:34:13 PM] Suyash: *that comment was for Sunil, not Akshay :")
[9/22/16, 2:34:36 PM] Sunil: Makes more sense now
[9/22/16, 2:34:48 PM] Suyash: I'm just playing squash here for fun, I don't think theres club here
[9/22/16, 2:35:02 PM] Sunil: You should start one then
[9/22/16, 2:35:38 PM] Akshay: Yup
[9/22/16, 2:35:48 PM] Akshay: But even club, ultimately is just for fun
[9/22/16, 2:36:06 PM] Akshay: Here they make a distinction between "sports clubs" and "club sports"
[9/22/16, 2:36:44 PM] Akshay: The difference being that club sports like tennis, actually send team to compete, while sports clubs are just groups created to play for fun at the uni. Eg fencing/archery
[9/22/16, 2:36:57 PM] Suyash: Yes
[9/22/16, 2:37:05 PM] Suyash: Akshay will you be travelling to other unis?
[9/22/16, 2:37:07 PM] Suyash: For club
[9/22/16, 2:37:10 PM] Akshay: Idk
[9/22/16, 2:37:26 PM] Akshay: But just yesterday, I got some email "Next tournament at Texas A and M"
[9/22/16, 2:37:43 PM] Sunil: Nice
[9/22/16, 2:37:50 PM] Suyash: Is that close to Houston?
[9/22/16, 2:37:54 PM] Akshay: Idk
[9/22/16, 2:38:23 PM] Suyash: Today I was forced to hit the gym
[9/22/16, 2:38:59 PM] Suyash: My roommates are regular, well-built but not extremely ripped
[9/22/16, 2:39:16 PM] Akshay: Nice
[9/22/16, 2:39:22 PM] Akshay: Why were you forced
[9/22/16, 2:39:24 PM] Akshay: Lol
[9/22/16, 2:43:31 PM] Suyash: They taught me some ab excervises, which I could barely do lol
[9/22/16, 2:43:54 PM] Suyash: I was almost gagging, coughing haha
[9/22/16, 2:44:07 PM] Suyash: Now it's paining when I sit up straight
[9/22/16, 2:53:04 PM] Akshay: Woah dude you're being ragged
[9/22/16, 2:55:21 PM] Suyash: Nah
[9/22/16, 2:55:30 PM] Suyash: This was normal ab excercise
[9/22/16, 2:55:47 PM] Suyash: Just my lack of fitness/ experience taking its toll
[9/22/16, 7:30:39 PM] Akshay: Lads I did chem well thank god
[9/22/16, 7:30:44 PM] Akshay: Hope the correction is also good
[9/22/16, 7:31:32 PM] Akshay: Suyash there's this guy here called Namanh, CS major, seems as good as you at CS and related knowledge-he's pretty good in the gym, sports etc
[9/22/16, 7:31:40 PM] Akshay: Man you need to raise your game
[9/22/16, 7:31:52 PM] Akshay: I was thinking of something a week ago
[9/22/16, 7:31:58 PM] Akshay: What about a group fitness challenge
[9/22/16, 7:32:26 PM] Akshay: Say something like, by the time we next meet, each person should be able to do so and so in terms of physical activity/ability
[9/22/16, 7:33:19 PM] Akshay: Thus creating an extrinsic motivation to stay healthy amidst the unwavering pressures of uni life and leap over the fence of mundane academia, lab reports et al!
[9/22/16, 8:03:36 PM] Sunil: That's not a bad idea
[9/22/16, 8:16:27 PM] Suyash: The food here is too good for any gains in fitness
[9/22/16, 8:16:56 PM] Suyash: I had 2 tacos, 2 pieces pizza, ice cream for a relatively light dinner :")
[9/22/16, 8:30:50 PM] Rahul: Dude but the tacos here (as in this part of the world ) is not like the Mexican one
[9/22/16, 8:31:09 PM] Rahul: U only get good tacos with nice bread if u go to an authentic Mexican restaurant
[9/22/16, 8:32:17 PM] Rahul: Like the tacos are like crisp here
[9/22/16, 8:34:02 PM] Rahul: Haha I had math midterm yesterday all stuff from Skool
[9/22/16, 8:34:57 PM] Rahul: In salims words " nothing nothiiing .... Full vacation "
[9/22/16, 8:35:35 PM] Rahul: My roommate is in baseball OS team
[9/22/16, 8:35:50 PM] Rahul: As a freshman üòØ
[9/22/16, 8:36:06 PM] Rahul: He can pitch up to 87MPH
[9/22/16, 8:36:40 PM] Rahul: In my suite I'm like the math guy here like I teach everyone
[9/22/16, 8:39:46 PM] Rahul: Yah dude here too the engineering professor said during the career fair u can skip class of u want to - like ppl here are very job focuses
[9/22/16, 8:39:54 PM] Rahul: *focussed
[9/22/16, 8:40:47 PM] Rahul: Like most ppl I have met have worked before , even freshman
[9/22/16, 8:40:58 PM] Rahul: I'm like the only one who never worked
[9/22/16, 8:50:33 PM] Suyash: Yup
[9/22/16, 8:50:41 PM] Suyash: It's super competitive
[9/22/16, 8:51:59 PM] Suyash: Everyday I face the same dilemma, whether to bathe or not - both tonight and tomorrow morning, or just one
[9/22/16, 8:58:00 PM] Rahul: Lol same
[9/22/16, 8:58:18 PM] Rahul: I just took bath after debating with myself for an hour
[9/22/16, 8:58:43 PM] Rahul: Shit but now I have to get a job
[9/22/16, 8:59:16 PM] Rahul: My aim is to get an internship / job by spring term
[9/22/16, 8:59:48 PM] Rahul: Bcos the career fair is there again in spring term
[9/22/16, 9:00:11 PM] Rahul: It's a weird paradox
[9/22/16, 9:02:29 PM] Rahul: To get a job everyone looks for experience
[9/22/16, 9:02:49 PM] Rahul: But no one is willing to give experience without u already having experience
[9/22/16, 9:03:00 PM] Akshay: Why is having bath a debate
[9/22/16, 9:03:41 PM] Akshay: Dude rahul I considered too about jobs and internships-I shall share with you what I/my eventually thought about it.
[9/22/16, 9:03:53 PM] Rahul: Like when I went in the career fair without a resume they said get some experience , u wud be a good employee but u need to get skills , experience , come back Spring / next year
[9/22/16, 9:04:00 PM] Akshay: As intl kids, an internship in US next summer would eat out of the OPT/CPT etc
[9/22/16, 9:04:21 PM] Akshay: Which could be potentially used for more meaningful internships after 2 or 3 yrs
[9/22/16, 9:04:30 PM] Akshay: Plus after first yr, I'd want to go home
[9/22/16, 9:04:49 PM] Akshay: Plus, many companies for civil eng at the career fair here said that they don't take freshmen
[9/22/16, 9:06:06 PM] Rahul: Yes exactly come back with experience is Wat they say
[9/22/16, 10:16:47 PM] Suyash: Yes
[9/22/16, 10:17:47 PM] Suyash: There are internships specifically for freshmen and sophomores at MS, G, FB etc
[9/22/16, 10:18:20 PM] Suyash: But they are mostly there to promote women, minorities in STEM
[9/22/16, 11:04:01 PM] Rahul: I think if qualify as monority here :¬£
[9/22/16, 11:04:08 PM] Rahul: *minority
[9/24/16, 1:03:18 PM] Akshay: Sup lads
[9/24/16, 1:03:40 PM] Udit: Hey yo

[9/24/16, 1:04:31 PM] Akshay: Ahh nice.
[9/24/16, 1:04:35 PM] Udit: Whoa!!!
[9/24/16, 1:04:54 PM] Suyash: Ive had just one day of class, not much taught - still given a lot of HW ffs
[9/24/16, 1:05:26 PM] Suyash: Today I'm going to watch a football game - UCLA Vs. Stanford
[9/24/16, 1:05:27 PM] Udit: Man it's gonna be same here
[9/24/16, 1:05:38 PM] Udit: Wow enjoy
[9/24/16, 1:05:44 PM] Suyash: Sadly, from the wrong end of the stadium!
[9/24/16, 1:06:57 PM] Akshay: Hahaha chill man
[9/24/16, 1:07:02 PM] Akshay: Just enjoy and work now
[9/24/16, 1:07:04 PM] Akshay: Seriously
[9/24/16, 1:07:11 PM] Suyash: Yes

[9/24/16, 1:07:24 PM] Suyash: I was not going to go for game
[9/24/16, 1:07:35 PM] Akshay: No time to just sit and stare, and contemplate, and think
[9/24/16, 1:07:45 PM] Akshay: As I became an expert at doing during the summer

[9/24/16, 2:50:27 PM] Udit: And for me it's 11 and 12 all over again
[9/24/16, 2:50:42 PM] Udit: üòí

[9/24/16, 2:53:05 PM] Akshay: But the questions are at a level of grade 12 or higher
[9/24/16, 2:53:18 PM] Akshay: Udit chill out then
[9/24/16, 2:53:32 PM] Udit: My 1st class micro eco

[9/24/16, 2:53:47 PM] Udit: Yeah..
[9/24/16, 2:53:51 PM] Akshay: From next year you'll have to really study
[9/24/16, 2:54:02 PM] Udit: Ya probably
[9/24/16, 8:47:43 PM] Suyash: Football game was meh
[9/24/16, 8:48:00 PM] Suyash: Ucla surprisingly leading until the 4th quarter

[9/24/16, 8:48:18 PM] Suyash: Concede 2 touchdowns!
[9/24/16, 8:55:19 PM] Akshay: I still haven't learnt the rules
[9/24/16, 8:55:43 PM] Suyash: Imho, it's a Bs sport
[9/24/16, 8:55:43 PM] Akshay: üòÉ couldnt be less bothered
[9/24/16, 8:55:52 PM] Suyash: Good, me neither from now on
[9/24/16, 8:55:59 PM] Suyash: I found it too slow
[9/24/16, 8:56:10 PM] Suyash: Discontinuous
[9/24/16, 8:56:10 PM] Akshay: Ahh ok
[9/24/16, 8:56:22 PM] Suyash: They pause very often, have timeouts etc
[9/24/16, 8:56:30 PM] Akshay: I have just won the civilian equivalent of a war
[9/24/16, 8:56:32 PM] Suyash: A one hour timed game, ends up taking 3 hrs
[9/24/16, 8:56:36 PM] Suyash: Woah what?
[9/24/16, 8:56:46 PM] Rahul: Yes it does
[9/24/16, 8:56:53 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[9/24/16, 8:59:47 PM] Akshay: That's only 'Normal tshirts'
[9/24/16, 8:59:54 PM] Akshay: Sports clothes separate
[9/24/16, 8:59:59 PM] Suyash: Ah I am probably not changing bedsheets
[9/24/16, 8:59:58 PM] Akshay: Shirts separate
[9/24/16, 8:59:59 PM] Rahul: Yah there r only like 10
[9/24/16, 9:00:09 PM] Rahul: ? For the year ?
[9/24/16, 9:00:20 PM] Suyash: I'm sure a layer of dust, dirt has already solidified lol
[9/24/16, 9:00:33 PM] Akshay: Are you'll having the problem that the sweaty clothes in the laundry make the room stink
[9/24/16, 9:00:40 PM] Suyash: I also have to do laundry - another herculean task for the beginner
[9/24/16, 9:00:56 PM] Akshay: Although I'm certain I have more sweaty clothes than you guys because of tennis/running
[9/24/16, 9:01:06 PM] Akshay: But you guys also play quite a bit of sport
[9/24/16, 9:01:35 PM] Rahul: I have more clothes to get sweaty - and I get them sweaty bcos gym everyday

[9/24/16, 9:02:06 PM] Rahul: I do once in 2 weeks
[9/24/16, 9:02:23 PM] Akshay: Alright
[9/24/16, 9:02:33 PM] Rahul: I just put on laundry bag and keep under the bed
[9/24/16, 9:03:21 PM] Rahul: But I was telling a funny story like the first time I did laundry I almost made Wat cud have been a disastrous mistake
[9/24/16, 9:03:53 PM] Rahul: I put the softener and the washing liquid in opposite places
[9/24/16, 9:04:11 PM] Rahul: And almost started
[9/24/16, 9:04:16 PM] Suyash: Ah I didn't even know we need softener
[9/24/16, 9:04:16 PM] Rahul: The machine
[9/24/16, 9:04:36 PM] Rahul: I use really less
[9/24/16, 9:04:48 PM] Rahul: Compared to the volume of clothes
[9/24/16, 9:05:10 PM] Suyash: You need to separate white and dark yeah?
[9/24/16, 9:05:20 PM] Rahul: Yes I do

[9/24/16, 9:14:12 PM] Akshay: Although I know my mother does that at home

[9/24/16, 9:14:40 PM] Akshay: I just use two with each wash
[9/24/16, 9:32:06 PM] Sunil: Even I don't separate light and dark
[9/24/16, 9:39:58 PM] Suyash: Good to know
[9/24/16, 9:40:13 PM] Suyash: I shall dump all clothes in, add a pod and relax :")
[9/24/16, 9:43:18 PM] Sunil: I finished my laundry in the morning üòÄ

[9/25/16, 6:46:56 AM] Akshay: Seriously something must be done about Syria
[9/25/16, 6:47:18 AM] Akshay: It's disgusting, the rest of the world watches on, content to let the killing continue
[9/25/16, 4:06:45 PM] Rahul: Dude , there's not much that can be done when it's not ur country and there r like 3 to 4 different groups having their own interests in the place
[9/25/16, 4:08:08 PM] Rahul: THey can only keep fighting and killing like bitches bcos everyone had their own ego
[9/25/16, 4:08:30 PM] Rahul: *has
[9/25/16, 4:16:13 PM] Rahul: https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/russias-interest-syria-not-assad/
[9/25/16, 4:19:04 PM] Rahul: http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/610780/US-Russia-military-showdown-INEVITABLE-MI6-ISIS-strikes
[9/25/16, 4:19:46 PM] Rahul: It's to complicated too end peacefully
[9/25/16, 4:21:27 PM] Rahul: It's become 10 times worse there since IS formed
[9/25/16, 4:23:59 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/25/16, 4:27:29 PM] Rahul: Why this sudden outbreak though , did u see something sad in the news ?
[9/25/16, 4:50:53 PM] Rahul: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/us-syria-policy-tatters-moderate-rebels-disband
[9/25/16, 5:02:07 PM] Akshay: Yeah I did
[9/25/16, 5:03:14 PM] Suyash: My roommate is Syrian, so I have refrained from this discussion in a while
[9/25/16, 6:28:31 PM] Rahul: I just became super nostalgic when I opened my physics 11th grade book to study for physics midterm and it smelt exactly the same as 2014
[9/25/16, 7:56:39 PM] Akshay: Ahh damn rahuls brain is inefficient because it has in memory the smells of 2014- hence less free space to learn something new :")
[9/25/16, 7:56:40 PM] Akshay: Jk
[9/25/16, 7:57:32 PM] Rahul: Actually it is more efficient bcos it can remember stuff from the past and relate it to the present
[9/25/16, 7:59:17 PM] Akshay: Maaaaaan
[9/26/16, 3:56:12 AM] Udit: In my 1st lecture!!!!

[9/26/16, 10:04:44 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/26/16, 10:04:54 AM] Akshay: Probably the closest I have been to an actual shooting
[9/26/16, 10:05:09 AM] Akshay: Shooting was at west uni place-6 injured
[9/26/16, 10:05:28 AM] Akshay: The triangular/pyramidal structure near "rice village" is my uni
[9/26/16, 10:11:00 AM] Suyash: Damn wtf
[9/26/16, 10:23:44 AM] Sunil: Oh damn
[9/26/16, 10:45:08 AM] Udit: Oh is everyone alright?!

[9/26/16, 12:36:44 PM] Akshay: Udit, six people were shot. No deaths reported, except for the shooter himself who was killed (I don't know whether it was the police or he shot himself)
[9/26/16, 1:47:22 PM] Udit: Whoa
[9/26/16, 1:47:26 PM] Udit: Duck
[9/26/16, 1:47:37 PM] Udit: Be safe mate

[9/26/16, 1:47:57 PM] Udit: Damn gud players
[9/26/16, 2:01:48 PM] Suyash: Good to know udit
[9/26/16, 2:03:49 PM] Suyash: Here the weather turned around in between a 2 hr lecture. When I went in, it was decent warm. Now 42 C, totally unexpected
[9/26/16, 2:13:53 PM] Udit: Wow
[9/26/16, 2:14:03 PM] Udit: It's probably 10 here
[9/26/16, 2:54:58 PM] Suyash: Damn that's really cold
[9/26/16, 7:15:00 PM] Akshay: Lads, I can now do ten push ups in a row!
[9/26/16, 7:15:21 PM] Akshay: When boards ended, I was unable to do even one properly
[9/26/16, 7:15:26 PM] Akshay: Lol
[9/26/16, 7:15:45 PM] Akshay: I bet rahul, who's probably the strongest in this weak group, can do like 25
[9/26/16, 8:34:14 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/26/16, 8:59:04 PM] Sunil: üòÇüòÇ
[9/27/16, 3:29:34 AM] Udit: üòÑüòÑ
[9/28/16, 9:09:18 AM] Akshay: Physics teacher was epic today
[9/28/16, 9:09:24 AM] Akshay: He kept dropping the chalk
[9/28/16, 9:09:37 AM] Udit: Chalk
[9/28/16, 9:09:41 AM] Udit: !!?
[9/28/16, 9:09:50 AM] Udit: U hv blackboard
[9/28/16, 9:09:55 AM] Sunil: How many times
[9/28/16, 9:10:11 AM] Akshay: Muttered "fuck this bs" under his breath, but was wearing the mike on his shirt, everyone started laughing
[9/28/16, 9:10:17 AM] Akshay: 3-4 times
[9/28/16, 9:10:21 AM] Sunil: üòÇ
[9/28/16, 9:10:24 AM] Akshay: Yeah all blackboard here
[9/28/16, 9:10:38 AM] Sunil: In my uni it's a mixture
[9/28/16, 9:10:58 AM] Udit: Oh wow
[9/28/16, 9:11:06 AM] Akshay: I haven't found him a really great teacher, but he's decent. No problem as such.
It's basically one hr of stand up comedy
[9/28/16, 9:11:15 AM] Akshay: He literally stands on the table
[9/28/16, 9:11:26 AM] Akshay: Jumps back down
[9/28/16, 9:11:55 AM] Akshay: Then to demo projectile motion, he played a game of beer pong, throwing a tt ball in a projectile path into the cup
[9/28/16, 9:12:24 AM] Akshay: Then when he missed, he flips out a can of beer from under his table, takes a few sips. This was two weeks ago
[9/28/16, 9:13:10 AM] Sunil: Wow he must be a very chilled guy
[9/28/16, 9:13:31 AM] Akshay: But I hear he's also a really intense/successful researcher
[9/28/16, 9:13:42 AM] Akshay: Probably just likes teaching the intro class
[9/28/16, 9:56:26 AM] Suyash: Damn what a legend
[9/28/16, 3:08:54 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/28/16, 3:09:37 PM] Suyash: Today one of the CS classes had a guy from Google LA, he mind fucked us totally
[9/28/16, 4:37:18 PM] Akshay: The room looks epic
[9/28/16, 4:37:35 PM] Akshay: As in, like a normal uni lecture hall
[9/28/16, 4:37:56 PM] Akshay: Doesn't look especially shabby because it's Ucla :") remember that's what you thought while in dubai
[9/28/16, 4:39:01 PM] Akshay: Uni correction is screwing me over
[9/28/16, 4:39:12 PM] Akshay: Yesterday, messed up physics midterm. Way too tough
[9/28/16, 4:39:23 PM] Akshay: Today got back marks of last week's chem. Ffs. 122/140
[9/28/16, 4:39:35 PM] Akshay: I thought I'd get at least 138
[9/28/16, 5:01:54 PM] Suyash: Dude 122 is epic
[9/28/16, 5:02:44 PM] Suyash: Almost 90%
[9/28/16, 5:03:25 PM] Suyash: I feel that uni marking will be like IB. Lower percentages but same difficulty for a good grade
[9/28/16, 5:10:05 PM] Rahul: Physics we have group midterm out of 12 and then individual midterm out of 88 . I think my group got 12/12 cos that problem was easy but in the individual midterm I think I might just touch 65-70
[9/28/16, 5:10:31 PM] Rahul: Honors physics is INSANE
[9/28/16, 5:10:57 PM] Rahul: I just came back from individual midterm
[9/28/16, 5:11:12 PM] Rahul: Like I screwed up so bad it was funny
[9/28/16, 6:11:44 PM] Suyash: Damn
[9/28/16, 6:12:33 PM] Suyash: Now there's a Google tech talk about internships etc. Hall is getting packed. The special few shall land an interview on the spot
[9/28/16, 6:26:47 PM] Rahul: Woah Wat do u need to do to be in the special few
[9/28/16, 8:08:56 PM] Suyash: I wish I knew
[9/28/16, 8:09:02 PM] Suyash: The tech talk was epic
[9/28/16, 8:10:20 PM] Suyash: The engineer played a round of coding challenges - like JAVA riddles mixed with jokes relates to Silicon Valley TV Show
[9/28/16, 8:11:16 PM] Suyash: Ah the irony - he was UIUC '15
[9/28/16, 8:13:46 PM] Suyash: This guy was a young chill guy - a starter at Google. In the morning that guy worked 5 yeas in Google India, 8 yrs here. So he was too experienced and senior for us
[9/29/16, 1:15:33 PM] Rahul: We have been having torrential downpours since yesterday
[9/29/16, 1:15:41 PM] Rahul: And. I forgot my umbrella

[9/29/16, 1:23:23 PM] Suyash: Damn
[9/29/16, 1:23:49 PM] Suyash: What is more worrying in such circumstances is laptop bag and phone :")
[9/29/16, 1:28:37 PM] Rahul: Phone is obviously functional
[9/29/16, 1:28:55 PM] Rahul: But I need to get a laptop bag
[9/29/16, 1:30:58 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[9/29/16, 1:35:31 PM] Suyash: Dubai type oppressive
[9/29/16, 1:35:45 PM] Suyash: Wake up sweaty all over
[9/29/16, 1:35:59 PM] Rahul: Woah shit

[9/29/16, 1:36:44 PM] Rahul: While rain CAN be a bit enjoyable heat never can
[9/29/16, 1:36:59 PM] Rahul: In excess
[9/29/16, 1:37:35 PM] Rahul: Dude today we had to make an adapted toy for disabled children in engineering lab
[9/29/16, 1:38:09 PM] Rahul: Like we had to use solder and stuff
[9/29/16, 1:38:14 PM] Sunil: Nice
[9/29/16, 1:38:27 PM] Sunil: Over here the weather's unpredictable
[9/29/16, 1:38:57 PM] Suyash: Woah Rahul that's fun
[9/29/16, 1:39:07 PM] Sunil: In the morning it's quite cold with some drizzle, and then by noon it's really hot
[9/29/16, 1:39:11 PM] Suyash: Here the CS stuff is boring and basically 9th grade stuff
[9/29/16, 1:39:16 PM] Rahul: It was
[9/29/16, 1:40:11 PM] Rahul: Like and they actually give our toy to a kid
[9/29/16, 1:40:29 PM] Rahul: Over here I learning MATLAB
[9/29/16, 1:40:38 PM] Rahul: Till now pretty easy
[9/29/16, 1:42:00 PM] Rahul: Till now just if statements , printing to screen , load commands , for and while loops , graphing in MATLAB etc etc basic stuff
[9/29/16, 2:01:00 PM] Udit: Well here I thought everything is going to be same as 12th grade
[9/29/16, 2:01:11 PM] Udit: But it is more research oriented
[9/29/16, 2:01:27 PM] Udit: I hv to do my own research
[9/29/16, 2:01:34 PM] Udit: I am doing on opec
[9/29/16, 2:01:46 PM] Udit: üôÇüôÇ
[9/29/16, 2:02:04 PM] Udit: Its actually more interesting than I thought
[9/29/16, 3:16:41 PM] Suyash: Nice Udit
[9/29/16, 3:16:54 PM] Suyash: I am doing C++
[9/29/16, 3:21:09 PM] Udit: Ohhh wow
[9/29/16, 6:20:06 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/29/16, 7:14:25 PM] Akshay: Yalla well done

[9/29/16, 7:14:43 PM] Suyash: It's painful!
[9/29/16, 7:14:57 PM] Suyash: Downhill is amazing
[9/29/16, 7:15:04 PM] Suyash: But uphill hurts
[9/29/16, 7:15:07 PM] Akshay: Dude rahul one day, I got caught up in the Library printing my chem lab report, then had to walk to the lab in the pouring rain
[9/29/16, 7:15:24 PM] Akshay: My umbrella broke a few steps into the walk, the wind was too much
[9/29/16, 7:15:27 PM] Akshay: Everything wet

[9/29/16, 7:15:38 PM] Akshay: It was a bath
[9/29/16, 7:15:44 PM] Suyash: Lolol
[9/29/16, 7:15:47 PM] Akshay: Sunil is right, here weather is unpredictable
[9/29/16, 7:16:09 PM] Akshay: If suyash remembers, I was chatting with him just before leaving from the library to the lab that day :")
[9/29/16, 7:16:38 PM] Suyash: Yup
[9/29/16, 7:16:54 PM] Akshay: Houston is sometimes hot, sometimes cold, and many times raining
[9/29/16, 7:17:25 PM] Akshay: These days, mornings are breezy, 22 Celsius or so. Then mid morning is hot, Ofc not like Dubai, but more humid, afternoon it rains
[9/29/16, 7:20:12 PM] Akshay: Suyash how much did it cost, the bike
[9/29/16, 7:20:15 PM] Suyash: Rain can get hard to accommodate I assume
[9/29/16, 7:20:34 PM] Suyash: It cost me 65 dollars until end of November
[9/29/16, 7:20:34 PM] Akshay: I never leave the room without umbrella in the bag
[9/29/16, 7:20:46 PM] Akshay: Although that's not always needed
[9/29/16, 7:20:50 PM] Suyash: I have not carried umbrella at all lol
[9/29/16, 7:21:06 PM] Akshay: In Texas, especially houston, they say weather report is bs
[9/29/16, 7:21:27 PM] Suyash: Here is feels hotter than it actually is
[9/29/16, 7:21:25 PM] Akshay: One day, it was so hot all day, night was a fucking hailstorm
[9/29/16, 7:21:48 PM] Suyash: I break into a sweat within 10-15 minutes of being outside
[9/29/16, 7:21:51 PM] Suyash: Cycling especially
[9/29/16, 7:22:04 PM] Suyash: Sometimes right after shower, start sweating
[9/29/16, 7:22:10 PM] Suyash: Get into bed, start sweating
[9/29/16, 7:22:11 PM] Akshay: Man suyash, sweating also happens when the body is too unfit to handle the heating up :")
[9/29/16, 7:22:34 PM] Suyash: Ahh
[9/29/16, 7:22:39 PM] Akshay: Jk

[9/29/16, 7:24:26 PM] Suyash: üòÇ
[9/29/16, 7:24:33 PM] Akshay: For ceve, we had a class when we walked around campus looking at hydrology structures
[9/29/16, 7:25:18 PM] Akshay: It was probably like 33 Celsius or so-"pleasant, springtime weather" in Dubai (in my opinion), my prof, his shirt became transparent with sweat, he needed to get water from us etc
[9/29/16, 7:25:30 PM] Akshay: He's I think 68 yr old, white
[9/29/16, 7:28:29 PM] Suyash: Ah 68 is quite old

[9/29/16, 7:35:39 PM] Akshay: I also had that confusion one day when we were discussing badminton at dinner. I said "cock", as expected, people understood another meaning :")

[10/6/16, 7:11:26 PM] Rahul: Dam
[10/6/16, 7:11:29 PM] Rahul: Unlucky
[10/6/16, 7:11:43 PM] Akshay: Dude I have established myself as the Duncan tt king, without even playing as much as you probably have
[10/6/16, 7:12:04 PM] Akshay: I just turned up this afternoon and beat all the people who play regularly-they're shitty
[10/6/16, 7:12:25 PM] Akshay: It was hard for them to believe that I am not the best player in UAE
[10/6/16, 7:12:27 PM] Akshay: :")
[10/6/16, 7:12:39 PM] Rahul: üôÇdum asses

[10/6/16, 7:13:45 PM] Akshay: I think udit would have beaten all of them except one
[10/6/16, 7:14:25 PM] Rahul: On a normal day he would have been equal to me but that day I played him was just LIT for me I thrashed him 5 games to nothing
[10/6/16, 7:14:37 PM] Akshay: Nice

[10/17/16, 4:16:46 PM] Rahul: I'll probably still get A when it's curved but still
[10/17/16, 4:17:11 PM] Rahul: But the hardest id say is engineering
[10/17/16, 4:17:22 PM] Rahul: We already finished MATLAB
[10/17/16, 4:17:36 PM] Rahul: Learnt how to use LINUX today
[10/17/16, 4:17:47 PM] Rahul: Tomorrow starting C++
[10/17/16, 4:29:24 PM] Akshay: Ok nice man
[10/17/16, 4:30:29 PM] Rahul: Thnx
[10/17/16, 4:58:21 PM] Suyash: Here they also gave honors college - but only for arts and sciences majors / courses

[10/17/16, 4:58:46 PM] Suyash: *have
[10/17/16, 5:00:33 PM] Akshay: Honours is seriously insane-wonder why rahul suddenly got the appetite to "go the extra mile" :")
[10/17/16, 5:00:50 PM] Suyash: Lol
[10/17/16, 5:00:53 PM] Akshay: In school physics, rahul lolol
[10/17/16, 5:01:03 PM] Suyash: Rahul is turning it all around in uni
[10/17/16, 5:01:16 PM] Akshay: Turning over a new leaf
[10/17/16, 5:01:34 PM] Akshay: I have finished writing my sociology essay midterm-I'll probably show you guys later
[10/17/16, 5:01:38 PM] Akshay: Going for tennis now
[10/17/16, 5:01:45 PM] Suyash: Nice
[10/17/16, 5:02:12 PM] Suyash: Right now there's a 5 minute break between each hour of Neurosciencr
[10/17/16, 5:02:47 PM] Suyash: Then theres Hack Nights, work on a short - but fully functional iOS project today, from 7-12 AM!
[10/17/16, 5:39:35 PM] Rahul: Wats that
[10/17/16, 6:23:42 PM] Rahul: Like wat do u have to do in it ?
[10/17/16, 6:27:19 PM] Suyash: It's like a 3 hr workshop
[10/17/16, 6:27:32 PM] Suyash: Last time it was 5 hrs
[10/17/16, 6:28:02 PM] Suyash: They introduce basics of a new language, and then build something - the aim is for you to learn a particular practical technology
[10/17/16, 6:28:08 PM] Suyash: This is for intermediates
[10/17/16, 6:28:26 PM] Rahul: So like for example last time Wat did u make
[10/17/16, 6:28:30 PM] Suyash: For complete beginners they have a 9 week course - 3 hrs a week on a different day
[10/17/16, 6:28:49 PM] Suyash: Oh yeah also each time they bring interns from a big company - and use that companies technology
[10/17/16, 6:28:53 PM] Suyash: Last time was FB
[10/17/16, 6:29:28 PM] Suyash: We built a web app that looks through events happening in UCLA and tells you which ones have free food
[10/17/16, 6:30:02 PM] Suyash: Obviously it's not a world changing idea, but it's for you to get a hang of the tech (this was PHP, Hack) and use it for your own projects
[10/17/16, 6:30:05 PM] Rahul: Dam
[10/17/16, 6:30:18 PM] Suyash: They have Q&A with interns, to get tips
[10/17/16, 6:30:21 PM] Suyash: Today is Apple
[10/17/16, 6:30:37 PM] Suyash: iOS development
[10/17/16, 6:31:23 PM] Suyash: The beginner course is for web dev, they introduced HTML/CSS, Javascript until now - this week is Node.JS
[10/17/16, 6:31:44 PM] Suyash: That is more about learning a general skill, rather than hacking together a quick project
[10/17/16, 7:34:28 PM] Suyash: The apple hardware intern is a ledge, he legit knows stuff about the next MacBook Pro etc, but is intelligently not disclosing lol
[10/17/16, 7:34:33 PM] Suyash: Also worked at Tesla
[10/20/16, 5:46:10 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>

[10/21/16, 4:04:36 PM] Udit: Dude

[10/21/16, 4:07:16 PM] Akshay: Lol the conversation has shifted to someone else who's name I cannot make out

[10/21/16, 4:53:22 PM] Udit: Ceos and directors were there not the actual people who employ
[10/21/16, 4:53:37 PM] Udit: They were just to represent their firm
[10/21/16, 4:53:44 PM] Udit: And talk about it
[10/21/16, 5:42:48 PM] Rahul: So it was like a thing to promote brands ur saying ?

[10/22/16, 9:56:02 AM] Akshay: üòÇ
[10/22/16, 9:56:23 AM] Akshay: He's a good guy, doesn't usually party/drink too much
[10/22/16, 9:56:28 AM] Akshay: So maybe it was too much for him
[10/22/16, 1:17:03 PM] Suyash: Lolol
[10/28/16, 9:18:50 AM] Akshay: Love my parents. Look at what they sent.

[10/28/16, 10:23:39 AM] Rahul: Yah how's life these days
[10/28/16, 10:24:09 AM] Rahul: I've become so used to ppl here calling me RA-OOL
[10/28/16, 10:24:24 AM] Rahul: that I have started saying my name that way
[10/28/16, 10:27:24 AM] Akshay: Rahool
[10/28/16, 10:27:32 AM] Akshay: Like raul
[10/28/16, 10:27:50 AM] Akshay: Life is decent, bordering on bad because of general chemistry grades
[10/28/16, 10:44:56 AM] Sunil: I hate chem labs
[10/28/16, 10:48:52 AM] Akshay: Me too man
[10/28/16, 10:48:59 AM] Akshay: Physics lab here isn't as bad
[10/28/16, 10:49:04 AM] Akshay: Chem is just insanity
[10/28/16, 10:49:23 AM] Akshay: Especially since many kids are doing these experiments without doing chem even at school
[10/28/16, 10:49:35 AM] Akshay: Yesterday we had to do some analysis of polymers
[10/28/16, 10:49:48 AM] Akshay: Ofc necessary information/advice is given, but still
[10/28/16, 10:50:27 AM] Akshay: Someone who just 2 weeks ago was learning about Lewis structure, cannot suddenly be made to learn about polymer synthesis, they don't even know organic chem
[10/28/16, 10:52:24 AM] Sunil: Dude I can feel your pain
[10/28/16, 10:52:37 AM] Sunil: We are doing the same experiments
[10/28/16, 11:00:14 AM] Akshay: Haha lol
[10/28/16, 11:07:41 AM] Suyash: I have no chem at all :)
[10/28/16, 11:11:05 AM] Akshay: I won't take it next semester
[10/28/16, 11:11:07 AM] Udit: Yup me neither :)
[10/28/16, 11:12:17 AM] Akshay: Lol
[10/28/16, 11:18:59 AM] Sunil: Definitely not
[11/2/16, 2:14:31 PM] Akshay: Sup lads
[11/2/16, 2:14:39 PM] Akshay: Udit are you back at Manchester
[11/2/16, 2:15:00 PM] Akshay: I'm now at 13 pushups without a break
[11/2/16, 2:15:22 PM] Akshay: Steady progress
[11/2/16, 2:32:38 PM] Rahul: I have 20 mins to go for my next phys midterm
[11/2/16, 2:32:47 PM] Rahul: Physics is going to kill me very soon
[11/2/16, 2:34:19 PM] Akshay: We'll meet you in the next world.
[11/2/16, 2:34:22 PM] Akshay: Adieu
[11/2/16, 2:34:33 PM] Akshay: I had second midterm yesterday
[11/2/16, 2:34:47 PM] Akshay: Lol sounds like you made the mistake of your life taking honors
[11/2/16, 2:35:21 PM] Suyash: Lolol Rahul :")
[11/2/16, 2:35:38 PM] Akshay: Honours physics- dishonourable marks.
[11/2/16, 5:20:43 PM] Rahul: Nah I think I shud be above 85 or so on this one
[11/2/16, 5:21:02 PM] Akshay: Great
[11/2/16, 5:21:17 PM] Rahul: If I get that that's a 15 percent improvement so I'll be happy
[11/2/16, 5:22:54 PM] Akshay: Yup
[11/2/16, 5:23:24 PM] Akshay: In uni physics, especially honours 85 is insane tbh-it's very difficult and the grading is weird
[11/2/16, 5:26:38 PM] Sunil: That's great Rahul
[11/2/16, 6:28:00 PM] Rahul: Trust me - there will be some bitch genius who gets 90+
[11/2/16, 6:28:25 PM] Rahul: Like last time when I got 70 I was full in boasting to this guy whose group I am in for lab
[11/2/16, 6:28:35 PM] Rahul: Turns out he got an 84
[11/2/16, 6:29:30 PM] Rahul: I think if they want to curve it leniently at the end they will need to exclude his grade and just give him full bcos otherwise he would break the curve
[11/3/16, 4:25:28 PM] Akshay: Was watching some old tennis match highlights on YouTube
[11/3/16, 4:25:56 PM] Akshay: Djokovic was dominating the point against fed, then somehow miraculously, Federer wins it
[11/3/16, 4:26:53 PM] Akshay: Commentator (Robbie Koenig is his name, he's a ledge in terms of wit) says-"Someone call 911. Federer has just escaped from jail!"
[11/4/16, 3:27:53 PM] Akshay: I got dunked
[11/4/16, 3:27:53 PM] Akshay: Bilal and some others came behind my chair while I was doing homework
[11/4/16, 3:27:53 PM] Akshay: Lifted me, carried to the tank and laid me in it
[11/4/16, 3:27:54 PM] Akshay: üòïüòÇ
[11/4/16, 3:28:18 PM] Akshay: It's a Duncan college tradition to put people inside this tank that we have
[11/4/16, 3:28:23 PM] Akshay: Fully clothed lol
[11/4/16, 3:28:27 PM] Akshay: Surprise ambush
[11/4/16, 3:28:38 PM] Akshay: Soaking wet now

[11/4/16, 4:01:08 PM] Akshay: Yes I should have
[11/4/16, 4:01:16 PM] Akshay: Good thing I cooperated peacefully
[11/4/16, 4:01:38 PM] Akshay: If ppl resist, it becomes funny, because people gang up on you and might have throw you in more forcefully
[11/4/16, 4:01:47 PM] Akshay: Might even*

[11/9/16, 3:32:41 PM] Akshay: No no udit is partially correct to say that
[11/9/16, 3:32:58 PM] Akshay: But udit, UK and US probably not as strict as UAE-so it's alright
[11/9/16, 3:33:28 PM] Udit: True that
[11/9/16, 3:33:56 PM] Udit: Btw guys I became the international students officer

[11/9/16, 4:26:13 PM] Rahul: Congrats Udit
[11/9/16, 4:26:26 PM] Rahul: My state .... very mixed
[11/9/16, 4:26:31 PM] Rahul: It's a swing state
[11/9/16, 4:26:57 PM] Rahul: So college campuses voted democratic mostly
[11/9/16, 4:27:14 PM] Rahul: But rural areas full republican
[11/9/16, 4:29:23 PM] Rahul: It was basically a US version of brexit
[11/9/16, 4:30:08 PM] Udit: Thnx guys!
[11/9/16, 4:30:44 PM] Udit: Sorry about the futile state rahul
[11/9/16, 4:30:48 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[11/9/16, 4:31:06 PM] Suyash: Tbh, I still think trump is a fine guy - will get shit done... The difference between a businessman and a lawyer, Wharton vs Yale :")
[11/9/16, 4:32:04 PM] Rahul: Let's hope so ......
[11/9/16, 4:32:19 PM] Udit: Yeah
[11/9/16, 4:33:00 PM] Suyash: He is favourable towards India, Indians it seems
[11/9/16, 4:33:40 PM] Rahul: Yeah seems like it
[11/9/16, 4:33:53 PM] Rahul: First candidate to target Indian Americans
[11/9/16, 4:33:59 PM] Udit: MODI sarkar
[11/9/16, 4:34:24 PM] Udit: So who is up for his new policy
[11/9/16, 4:34:41 PM] Rahul: Whose ?
[11/9/16, 4:35:01 PM] Udit: The 500 and 1000 rupee
[11/9/16, 4:35:06 PM] Udit: Removal
[11/9/16, 4:35:14 PM] Rahul: Oh yah that was a smart thing
[11/9/16, 4:35:33 PM] Rahul: I heard he gonna do a 2000 r note ?
[11/9/16, 4:35:42 PM] Udit: Yeah
[11/9/16, 4:36:14 PM] Udit: I hv a feeling Indian currency to fall
[11/9/16, 4:36:22 PM] Udit: And there a higher value note
[11/9/16, 4:36:46 PM] Rahul: But I don't get why he don't just issue new 500 and 1000 r notes after taking ppl deposit old ones
[11/9/16, 4:37:01 PM] Rahul: Like why did he issue the 2000 ?
[11/9/16, 4:37:09 PM] Udit: He is for a 500 rupee
[11/9/16, 4:37:25 PM] Rahul: Yah I know but why not 1000 too
[11/9/16, 4:38:17 PM] Rahul: Is that only bcos it's a slightly useless denomination when there is a 500 ... or is there another reason?
[11/9/16, 6:38:03 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/16, 10:07:30 AM] Akshay: I was feeling weirdly sad today
[11/14/16, 10:07:36 AM] Akshay: Having an insanely busy week
[11/14/16, 10:07:53 AM] Akshay: My mother yesterday wishes me "happy children's day" of all things
[11/14/16, 10:08:08 AM] Akshay: Lol I'm 18- now even that celebration is not valid :")
[11/14/16, 10:21:04 AM] Sunil: Haha true

[11/14/16, 3:08:10 PM] Akshay: !
[11/14/16, 8:27:40 PM] Rahul: I am going to India in the holiday
[11/14/16, 8:28:25 PM] Sunil: Nice
[11/14/16, 8:28:41 PM] Sunil: But are you also visiting Dubai?
[11/14/16, 8:29:28 PM] Suyash: I will be in Dubai from 10th to the 7th. What about you guys?
[11/14/16, 8:31:52 PM] Sunil: From 17th to 12th
[11/14/16, 8:50:30 PM] Akshay: 15 dec to 7 jan
[11/14/16, 8:50:36 PM] Akshay: Dubai only
[11/14/16, 8:52:08 PM] Suyash: Akshay your holiday seems quite less
[11/14/16, 8:52:54 PM] Suyash: If my exams got over a bit earlier, I could've left around the 4th like others :/
[11/14/16, 9:58:57 PM] Akshay: Ahh lol
[11/14/16, 9:59:18 PM] Akshay: Yup I can also leave earlier if I have earlier exams but usually gen chem is right at the end
[11/14/16, 9:59:34 PM] Akshay: Best to play safe, hence tickets booked for 14
[11/14/16, 9:59:50 PM] Akshay: Wonder how rahul is fairing with his honours physics
[11/14/16, 10:00:11 PM] Akshay: Regular physics is hard enough, just finished this week's assignment
[11/14/16, 10:06:50 PM] Rahul: Mine is 18 th to 6th Jan
[11/14/16, 10:07:00 PM] Rahul: In between 5 days in India
[11/14/16, 10:07:21 PM] Akshay: That's even shorter lol
[11/14/16, 10:07:53 PM] Rahul: Yah
[11/14/16, 10:08:02 PM] Akshay: OS man
[11/14/16, 10:08:09 PM] Akshay: Works ppl too hard
[11/14/16, 10:08:15 PM] Rahul: Just finished physics, engineering assignments
[11/14/16, 10:08:24 PM] Akshay: Transfer to Ucla, suyash is chilling
[11/14/16, 10:08:35 PM] Akshay: Going on wknds to Berkeley to do nothing :")
[11/14/16, 10:08:41 PM] Rahul: Waking up at 5 to starts lab report due tomorrow night
[11/14/16, 10:08:47 PM] Akshay: Oh lol same

[11/14/16, 10:09:02 PM] Akshay: I'm staying from now till 12 to finish ceve test due tomorrow morning
[11/14/16, 10:09:07 PM] Rahul: It's 1AM:)
[11/14/16, 10:09:31 PM] Suyash: I shall watch some.comedy now; sleep by 11 to secure atleast 9 hrs :")
[11/14/16, 10:09:42 PM] Akshay: Now till 2 sorry, it is 12 rn in Houston
[11/14/16, 10:09:52 PM] Suyash: It's 10 here :"")
[11/14/16, 10:10:00 PM] Rahul: Woah
[11/14/16, 10:10:02 PM] Akshay: Lol suyash might sleep more in 3 days than rahul does in a weel
[11/14/16, 10:10:03 PM] Akshay: Week
[11/14/16, 10:10:30 PM] Rahul: üòä
[11/14/16, 10:10:38 PM] Rahul: Ok I üò¥
[11/14/16, 10:11:36 PM] Suyash: Lol I still remember when Rahul decided to sleep at 10 PM before Grade 10 second term geo exam. Then wakes up - acc to alarm - at 3 to study... Only to find out next day is a holiday :")
[11/14/16, 10:12:00 PM] Akshay: No no no
[11/14/16, 10:12:02 PM] Akshay: That's incorrect
[11/14/16, 10:12:12 PM] Akshay: Oh probably not
[11/14/16, 10:12:37 PM] Suyash: Idk when, but another incident is when he slept off at 4 PM to take a power nap, woke up at like 11 the night before an exam :")
[11/14/16, 10:12:45 PM] Akshay: But that night, 10:58, he called me, my mom picked up, rahul without thinking just shouts-"Chuck the geo book in the bin"
[11/14/16, 10:13:06 PM] Suyash: Ah perhaps you're right
[11/14/16, 10:13:06 PM] Akshay: Then when I got the phone, he repeated the same, told me about the holiday for expo 2020
[11/14/16, 10:13:31 PM] Akshay: But I was still thankful that rahul said chuck instead of another rhyming word
[11/14/16, 10:13:49 PM] Akshay: Because I never expected him to yell into the phone especially when my mother picked up
[11/14/16, 10:14:00 PM] Suyash: Lolol
[11/14/16, 10:14:17 PM] Suyash: I remember that he strangely puts alarms at like 3 AM, and sleeps from 9 to 3
[11/14/16, 10:14:38 PM] Suyash: Also now Im remembering a story from Arya
[11/14/16, 10:15:10 PM] Suyash: About a guy who flipped over his life schedule so as to get to revise just before boards, instead of sleeping just before
[11/14/16, 10:15:29 PM] Suyash: And then Arya made us write up a time table in Hindi
[11/14/16, 10:15:49 PM] Akshay: Rahul's most epic night was when he slept at 11 to wake up at 1
[11/14/16, 10:15:58 PM] Suyash: Lololol
[11/14/16, 10:16:00 PM] Akshay: I think grade 11 third term
[11/15/16, 4:52:11 AM] Rahul: 10th grade was the shit man
[11/15/16, 4:52:37 AM] Rahul: Since then my life went consistently downhill
[11/15/16, 7:16:04 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/15/16, 7:17:45 AM] Sunil: Ah I've seen this one
[11/15/16, 7:36:17 AM] Udit: Omg!
[11/15/16, 7:38:34 AM] Udit: How do u think so many Indian businesses are still surviving
[11/15/16, 12:40:21 PM] Rahul: I got 82 in physics üò•
[11/15/16, 12:40:36 PM] Rahul: Midterm
[11/15/16, 12:41:00 PM] Akshay: Not bad, improvement of 12 right?
[11/15/16, 12:41:06 PM] Rahul: Yes
[11/15/16, 12:41:08 PM] Akshay: I got 87 then 84
[11/15/16, 12:41:19 PM] Akshay: Non honours lol
[11/15/16, 12:41:39 PM] Rahul: Until that dude in my group I was telling u about got a 96
[11/15/16, 12:41:52 PM] Akshay: Ahh
[11/15/16, 12:42:01 PM] Akshay: Here I know someone who got 95, then 100
[11/15/16, 12:42:18 PM] Rahul: Man where this fuckers come from
[11/15/16, 12:42:22 PM] Rahul: *these
[11/15/16, 12:43:05 PM] Rahul: That getsuch high score evenin uni
[11/16/16, 7:09:39 PM] Akshay: https://youtu.be/qwbSXgV8YPU
[11/16/16, 7:09:50 PM] Akshay: And that is your world number 1!
[11/16/16, 7:10:21 PM] Suyash: I expected it to be about El Shorbagy!
[11/16/16, 7:13:03 PM] Sunil: Squash player?
[11/16/16, 7:14:15 PM] Akshay: Yup he's the squash no 1
[11/16/16, 7:14:27 PM] Akshay: But the above video is about someone else suyash :")
[11/19/16, 7:12:12 AM] Akshay: It's 7 Celsius in Houston
[11/19/16, 7:12:16 AM] Akshay: I went running
[11/19/16, 7:12:28 AM] Akshay: Even after covering completely, so cold that lungs hurt when I ran slightly faster
[11/19/16, 7:12:28 AM] Akshay: Breathing is tough
[11/19/16, 7:12:28 AM] Akshay: I have experienced another force of nature
[11/19/16, 7:12:59 AM] Akshay: If it remains at this kind of temp, single digit, my situation might be worse than rahuls in ohio
[11/19/16, 7:13:28 AM] Akshay: Over there it's expected to be cold, they have room heater,indoor facilities etc for sports
[11/19/16, 7:13:46 AM] Akshay: Here, nothing. No room heating, all sports stuff is outdoor
[11/19/16, 7:14:57 AM] Akshay: Worst part is that this temperature isn't recognized as bad. Ppl are probably welcoming this weather for Christmas et al-after the "extreme heat" (lol average was only 25-32 Celsius) in August
[11/19/16, 7:28:50 AM] Akshay: Sunil, expect it's similar for you?
[11/19/16, 7:29:43 AM] Udit: Akshay think of mine then
[11/19/16, 7:29:49 AM] Udit: It's 7 today
[11/19/16, 7:29:56 AM] Udit: After loads of days
[11/19/16, 7:30:04 AM] Udit: It usually is 2-3
[11/19/16, 7:30:22 AM] Udit: üò¢üò¢üò¥üò¥
[11/19/16, 7:31:14 AM] Akshay: But again-do you not have heating etc? As in, UK is "expected" to be cold
[11/19/16, 7:31:38 AM] Udit: Yeah yeah
[11/19/16, 7:31:47 AM] Udit: Still
[11/19/16, 7:34:41 AM] Sunil: Yeah it's 6 rn
[11/19/16, 7:37:24 AM] Rahul: Here is 4
[11/19/16, 7:38:17 AM] Rahul: Inside room is 20
[11/19/16, 8:08:14 AM] Akshay: Ahh rahul that's cold
[11/19/16, 8:08:29 AM] Akshay: For my sister in nyc, it went to 1 two weeks ago
[11/19/16, 8:08:50 AM] Akshay: But some days it's warmer there than houston. Pretty erratic. Ofc heating etc is available
[11/19/16, 10:44:08 AM] Rahul: Dude it just started snowing I think the winds r 20 MPH
[11/19/16, 10:46:48 AM] Rahul: <‚Äévideo omitted>

[11/19/16, 10:49:08 AM] Rahul: Cud u hear it
[11/19/16, 10:49:11 AM] Akshay: Rahul can now beef up, the muscle and fat are necessary to handle such weather.
[11/19/16, 10:49:13 AM] Akshay: Yeah lol
[11/19/16, 10:49:20 AM] Udit: Wow
[11/19/16, 10:49:24 AM] Udit: Enjoy
[11/19/16, 10:49:40 AM] Rahul: It just completely stopped within 2 mins
[11/19/16, 10:49:57 AM] Udit: Well that's luck
[11/19/16, 10:49:59 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/19/16, 10:50:14 AM] Udit: So when do u guys usually wake up
[11/19/16, 10:50:31 AM] Rahul: 10 AM on weekends
[11/19/16, 10:50:39 AM] Udit: Weekdays?

[11/19/16, 4:07:01 PM] Akshay: I've come for some sort of Indian/cultural program
[11/19/16, 4:07:52 PM] Akshay: It hasn't begun yet, but on a brochure there so many Indian sounding names-I wonder where all these "Indians" are lol

[11/20/16, 1:04:15 PM] Suyash: I still feel stuff in Dubai is cheaper
[11/20/16, 1:04:21 PM] Udit: I don't
[11/20/16, 1:04:27 PM] Udit: Atleast clothing
[11/20/16, 1:04:44 PM] Udit: Plus I hv 15% discount on almost everything
[11/20/16, 1:04:51 PM] Suyash: Oh yeah
[11/20/16, 1:04:59 PM] Suyash: Here we don't get such discounts
[11/20/16, 1:05:15 PM] Udit: That's student discount
[11/20/16, 1:05:53 PM] Suyash: Mostly limited to nearby food outlets, HBO GO etc and student discount on trains, some flights
[11/20/16, 1:06:10 PM] Akshay: I haven't been shopping too much. From what I've seen, definitely agree that for most kinds of things that we may buy-Dubai is cheaper, but I've seen much more variety in US. 
For stuff like food, the flavours are much different from Dubai-which is good and bad in ways
[11/20/16, 1:06:27 PM] Akshay: Sports good et al much much cheaper in US!
[11/20/16, 1:06:33 PM] Suyash: UK I feel is even more expensive than US
[11/20/16, 1:06:37 PM] Akshay: Tennis ball just 2$ for box of three
[11/20/16, 1:06:43 PM] Akshay: UK is most expensive
[11/20/16, 1:06:45 PM] Udit: McDonald's veg burger tastes different here
[11/20/16, 1:06:48 PM] Akshay: Especially London
[11/20/16, 1:06:54 PM] Suyash: üòÇ
[11/20/16, 1:06:57 PM] Akshay: Dude udit
[11/20/16, 1:06:59 PM] Udit: No no
[11/20/16, 1:07:06 PM] Akshay: Confirm it was a veg burger!
[11/20/16, 1:07:17 PM] Udit: God knows
[11/20/16, 1:07:21 PM] Suyash: Surprisingly, I have never had McDonalds, KFC yet
[11/20/16, 1:07:23 PM] Akshay: I doubt they have that in UK, in fact most places they don't
[11/20/16, 1:07:36 PM] Udit: I think it was' vegan' burger
[11/20/16, 1:07:39 PM] Suyash: That was a weekly staple in Dubai
[11/20/16, 1:07:45 PM] Suyash: Vegan is too much
[11/20/16, 1:07:44 PM] Akshay: In US surprisingly the things that other countries know the US for as surprisingly not too popular.
[11/20/16, 1:07:52 PM] Udit: It's disgusting
[11/20/16, 1:07:58 PM] Akshay: Like whatsapp, KFC, McDonald's
[11/20/16, 1:08:08 PM] Akshay: Are*
[11/20/16, 1:08:14 PM] Udit: While cming from dubai my meal was vegan
[11/20/16, 1:08:17 PM] Udit: Yuck
[11/20/16, 1:08:23 PM] Akshay: Lol vegan
[11/20/16, 1:13:13 PM] Suyash: http://www.lovethisgif.com/uploaded_images/84378-Black-Friday-Stampede-Animated-Gif.gif
[11/20/16, 1:14:05 PM] Suyash: It is crazy in US
[11/20/16, 2:33:48 PM] Rahul: I'm going to Pennsylvania
[11/20/16, 2:33:58 PM] Rahul: In TG
[11/20/16, 2:34:16 PM] Akshay: Nice. Where will you go/stay
[11/20/16, 2:36:34 PM] Rahul: Cousins house
[11/20/16, 2:42:22 PM] Akshay: Good
[11/22/16, 5:45:52 AM] Udit: New type of demand curve learned
[11/22/16, 5:45:59 AM] Udit: Kinked demand curve
[11/22/16, 5:47:17 AM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/22/16, 5:47:45 AM] Udit: Has ib done this?
[11/22/16, 5:48:23 AM] Akshay: Oi idiot, we did it in ISC...sort of briefly
[11/22/16, 5:48:48 AM] Akshay: IB has done it yes
[11/22/16, 6:45:06 AM] Sunil: We've also learned this Udit
[11/22/16, 7:15:37 AM] Udit: U sure
[11/22/16, 7:15:48 AM] Udit: Kinked demand curve?
[11/22/16, 7:15:56 AM] Udit: Oh yeah!!
[11/22/16, 7:16:12 AM] Udit: I remember kc drawing the graph
[11/22/16, 7:20:42 AM] Sunil: Come on Udit üòÇ
[11/22/16, 7:25:34 AM] Udit: See how easy eco is here
[11/22/16, 10:53:19 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/22/16, 10:53:25 AM] Akshay: Have you'll seen this whatsapp joke
[11/22/16, 10:53:37 AM] Udit: Yeah
[11/22/16, 10:53:41 AM] Udit: üòÖüòÖ
[11/22/16, 10:56:04 AM] Sunil: Ya üòÇ
[11/27/16, 6:35:14 AM] Sunil: When do you guys have your finals?
[11/27/16, 6:37:05 AM] Akshay: Dec 3 onwards.
[11/27/16, 6:38:15 AM] Sunil: Mine's from 10th
[11/27/16, 6:39:00 AM] Akshay: Sorry mine from 5th
[11/27/16, 6:40:19 AM] Sunil: Just a week left then
[11/27/16, 6:40:33 AM] Akshay: Yup just a week
[11/27/16, 6:40:45 AM] Akshay: It's honestly way less pressure than school exams
[11/27/16, 6:40:52 AM] Sunil: True
[11/27/16, 6:41:12 AM] Akshay: I've been doing pretty crap the last few exams but there's not much to be done as preparation.
[11/27/16, 6:41:40 AM] Sunil: It's difficult to score in English
[11/27/16, 6:47:31 AM] Akshay: Ah
[11/27/16, 6:47:50 AM] Akshay: I'm not doing English, don't know tbh.
It's difficult to score in chemistry!
[11/27/16, 6:52:22 AM] Sunil: I'm just so glad that I just have one more chem lab left
[11/27/16, 6:57:09 AM] Akshay: Haha
[11/27/16, 10:11:58 AM] Suyash: I have exams on 3rd, 7th and 8th
[11/27/16, 10:12:34 AM] Suyash: But essays, project etc still due until day before - so most studying will be last minute
[11/27/16, 10:12:58 AM] Suyash: Do y'all agree that one courses portion can be finished on the day before?
[11/27/16, 10:16:17 AM] Akshay: No
[11/27/16, 10:18:18 AM] Suyash: Damn
[11/27/16, 10:18:24 AM] Sunil: Nope
[11/27/16, 10:25:55 AM] Akshay: Dude that's crazy
[11/27/16, 10:26:23 AM] Akshay: My math portion is actually quite significant-probably about 60% of isc and the sums are quite tricky.
[11/27/16, 10:26:29 AM] Akshay: Practice is also needed
[11/27/16, 10:26:57 AM] Akshay: Chem and physics will take time to iron out imperfections-especially considering how much I've screwed up so far
[11/27/16, 10:26:59 AM] Udit: My exams are in jan
[11/27/16, 10:27:12 AM] Udit: I'll hv to study over the winter break
[11/27/16, 10:27:29 AM] Akshay: Lolololol that's quite I call a mess
[11/27/16, 10:27:42 AM] Udit: And yet the number of essays now are crazy
[11/27/16, 10:28:37 AM] Udit: I have a reading of 250 pages due tmr
[11/27/16, 10:28:48 AM] Udit: Messed up
[11/27/16, 10:34:45 AM] Akshay: Lol I never finish readings. Impossible. I sort of glance through the first ten pages, then sometimes look at the last page
[11/27/16, 10:35:57 AM] Suyash: Here I've had 1 less month of school - so my Math for eg. is half of what Akshay has! They split multivariable into diff and integral, I have only diff
[11/27/16, 10:36:37 AM] Suyash: Also fewer courses overall this term, no Physics. No Chem ever as well
[11/27/16, 10:36:49 AM] Suyash: I have still not understood the concept of readings
[11/27/16, 10:37:06 AM] Suyash: Do they really affect your final score on the exam?
[11/27/16, 10:37:27 AM] Suyash: Indirectly, because you have read - is it an edge
[11/27/16, 10:38:01 AM] Akshay: Usually reading is in humanities type courses more
[11/27/16, 10:38:34 AM] Akshay: Many lectures you will have absolutely no idea what's going on if you don't read
[11/27/16, 10:38:57 AM] Akshay: It's more a question of being involved in the class
[11/27/16, 10:39:31 AM] Akshay: The teacher doesn't introduce the topic always-sometimes it's straight onto a discussion like "So, Sassen, in the chapter I assigned, says that..."
[11/27/16, 10:39:44 AM] Suyash: True - then I'll be doing a lot of it next term
[11/27/16, 10:40:29 AM] Akshay: And for my sociology class, we had random quizzes throughout semester. So 6 quizzes (only on Fridays, but unannounced) , each of 5 points, based on that week's reading
[11/27/16, 10:40:40 AM] Akshay: Best 5 would be counted, for 25% of the grade
[11/27/16, 10:40:59 AM] Suyash: That's quite a lot
[11/27/16, 10:42:18 AM] Akshay: But not all courses directly test the reading. At RICE, they say professors do test it just to encourage reading. Otherwise people can just skip it completely and will obviously do badly in the exam/paper
[11/27/16, 10:42:43 AM] Suyash: Yup
[11/27/16, 10:43:18 AM] Suyash: Here for neuroscience, the readings are from a course reader - which is sorta too deep / beyond scope for a GE
[11/27/16, 10:43:42 AM] Suyash: Going through presentation, notes is enough for 90% of the paper
[11/28/16, 8:40:24 AM] Rahul: If I didn't wake up late today......
[11/28/16, 8:57:19 AM] Akshay: What
[11/28/16, 8:59:34 AM] Rahul: Shooting
[11/28/16, 8:59:47 AM] Rahul: Many dead, injured
[11/28/16, 8:59:55 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/28/16, 9:00:00 AM] Suyash: Shit
[11/28/16, 9:00:07 AM] Suyash: Where did it happen?
[11/28/16, 9:00:10 AM] Suyash: Relative to you
[11/28/16, 9:00:18 AM] Rahul: 15 min walk
[11/28/16, 9:00:31 AM] Suyash: Fuck
[11/28/16, 9:00:46 AM] Rahul: Around where I would have eaten breakfast, gone to class if I decided to go to physics lecture this morning
[11/28/16, 9:00:56 AM] Rahul: I felt too lazy and stayed in dorm
[11/28/16, 9:01:06 AM] Rahul: I was far away from it
[11/28/16, 9:01:44 AM] Rahul: It started in one of the residence halls
[11/28/16, 9:01:54 AM] Rahul: Someone pulled the fire alarm
[11/28/16, 9:02:12 AM] Rahul: When people came out there was a car waiting to mow them
[11/28/16, 9:02:20 AM] Rahul: Also at Chem eng bldg
[11/28/16, 9:02:25 AM] Rahul: Chlorine leak
[11/28/16, 9:02:39 AM] Rahul: Then someone started shooting
[11/28/16, 9:03:42 AM] Akshay: Fuck
[11/28/16, 9:04:00 AM] Akshay: Thank God for rahul still being able to chat
[11/28/16, 9:04:47 AM] Rahul: It's very weird
[11/28/16, 9:05:16 AM] Rahul: Some ppl are saying there was a shooter, some ppl saying they didn't hear a shooter
[11/28/16, 9:05:32 AM] Rahul: Nevertheless, one suspect was killed
[11/28/16, 9:06:08 AM] Akshay: Fuck all that mate. Did the shooter kill anyone?
[11/28/16, 9:06:35 AM] Rahul: Yes
[11/28/16, 9:07:38 AM] Akshay: Damn
[11/28/16, 9:07:52 AM] Akshay: If such bs continues, it'll be really scary
[11/28/16, 9:08:01 AM] Akshay: First Ucla in summer, now OS
[11/28/16, 9:08:46 AM] Akshay: Texas is no way behind-2 Fridays ago I went to a place called Midtown for sociology field trip, the same day I saw a report about a shooting there
[11/28/16, 9:08:57 AM] Akshay: This is pretty terrible
[11/28/16, 9:09:15 AM] Akshay: Lol one can see the benefits of not being a conscientious student
[11/28/16, 10:04:50 AM] Suyash: Mow them?
[11/28/16, 10:40:05 AM] Akshay: Like run them over, I guess
[11/28/16, 10:53:21 AM] Rahul: Yes
[11/29/16, 4:26:26 PM] Akshay: Did you'll hear about the plane crash in Colombia
[11/29/16, 4:31:58 PM] Sunil: Yeah I did
[11/29/16, 4:45:37 PM] Rahul: Yes
[11/29/16, 4:46:29 PM] Udit: Yeah
[11/29/16, 4:48:28 PM] Udit: So sad man
[11/29/16, 4:51:39 PM] Akshay: Yup
[11/29/16, 4:52:16 PM] Akshay: Ppl are making a bigger deal of the football team players in the plane who died-but imo that's bs, because everyone's life is equally important
[11/29/16, 6:03:58 PM] Suyash: Agreed
[11/29/16, 7:30:06 PM] Akshay: http://the18.com/soccer-news/twin-sisters-womens-world-cup-usa-mexico-u-20
[11/30/16, 12:40:06 AM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/30/16, 8:45:56 AM] Suyash: :")
[12/1/16, 9:07:26 PM] Suyash: ‚ÄúDetermine if a person ‚Äòx‚Äô is bewafa, what is the probablity that Sonam Gupta is bewafa given a dependence structure between variables where all variables are binary and their high values mean the following: G means gender of ‚Äòx‚Äô is female (~G means the opposite), S means biological parents of ‚Äòx‚Äô are strict with her, W means x is wealthy, A means x is attractive, L means x has lots of options, B means x is bewafa, C means at least one other person y claims that the person x is bewafa.‚Äù
[12/1/16, 9:07:37 PM] Suyash: IIT Question :")
[12/1/16, 9:08:31 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/2/16, 9:02:44 AM] Akshay: Done with all classes for first semester!
[12/2/16, 9:11:32 AM] Sunil: Nice
[12/2/16, 9:11:41 AM] Sunil: My classes get over on 7th
[12/2/16, 9:22:10 AM] Akshay: Ahh next Wednesday. I remember you also started on a Wednesday, am I right?
[12/2/16, 9:22:13 AM] Akshay: Or Thursday
[12/2/16, 9:23:06 AM] Sunil: I started on a Thursday
[12/2/16, 9:24:36 AM] Akshay: Yup
[12/2/16, 8:38:12 PM] Akshay: Happy UAE national day btw :")
[12/2/16, 8:38:22 PM] Akshay: Should never forget where we come from
[12/2/16, 8:39:08 PM] Suyash: Lol :"")
[12/4/16, 3:57:01 AM] Udit: I am an Indian
[12/4/16, 3:57:16 AM] Udit: Lived in India most of my life
[12/4/16, 3:57:31 AM] Udit: So yeah. :-P
[12/6/16, 3:49:27 PM] Rahul: Bruh I'm so relieved my software design project was easier than it looked
[12/6/16, 3:50:01 PM] Udit: I have a submission on Sunday
[12/6/16, 3:50:07 PM] Udit: 2500 word essay
[12/6/16, 3:50:13 PM] Udit: üò•üò•
[12/6/16, 3:50:14 PM] Rahul: We had to use a micro controller to detect the frequency of an infrared transmitter
[12/6/16, 3:50:25 PM] Rahul: üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜUdit
[12/6/16, 3:50:32 PM] Udit: That at least sounds interesting
[12/6/16, 3:50:56 PM] Rahul: Bruh... u shud be doing engineering then
[12/6/16, 3:51:09 PM] Udit: I should be
[12/6/16, 3:51:14 PM] Udit: Indeed
[12/6/16, 3:51:34 PM] Rahul: There is always time to switch
[12/6/16, 3:51:44 PM] Sunil: Guys how are your preparations going for finals
[12/6/16, 3:51:48 PM] Udit: I don't think so
[12/6/16, 3:51:59 PM] Rahul: Finals...
[12/6/16, 3:52:03 PM] Rahul: Haven't started
[12/6/16, 3:52:04 PM] Udit: Mine is in Jan
[12/6/16, 3:52:16 PM] Rahul: I'm screwed for finals
[12/6/16, 3:52:23 PM] Sunil: Same
[12/6/16, 3:52:25 PM] Rahul: Especially engineering
[12/6/16, 3:52:29 PM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/6/16, 3:52:29 PM] Udit: U always are aren't u
[12/6/16, 3:52:33 PM] Udit: But still top
[12/6/16, 3:52:39 PM] Udit: So chill
[12/6/16, 3:52:42 PM] Rahul: The last few classes of C++
[12/6/16, 3:52:56 PM] Rahul: I understood only 49 percent wat was going on
[12/6/16, 3:53:16 PM] Suyash: You mustve done classes/structs ?
[12/6/16, 3:53:19 PM] Rahul: In structs, classes, objects, overloaded functions
[12/6/16, 3:53:23 PM] Rahul: Yes
[12/6/16, 3:53:28 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/16, 3:53:30 PM] Rahul: It's confusing first time
[12/6/16, 3:53:39 PM] Rahul: U must be an expert in it by now
[12/6/16, 3:53:48 PM] Suyash: Do they give you projects etc as HW?
[12/6/16, 3:54:06 PM] Suyash: Nah it was new for me as well, but now I'm clear - final was decent
[12/6/16, 3:54:17 PM] Rahul: There is a daily homework assignment on the topic covered in class
[12/6/16, 3:54:38 PM] Suyash: You did pointers, cstrings and stuff yeah? That's imo the hardest
[12/6/16, 3:54:49 PM] Rahul: This design project is like capping of the semester before final... an application of everything learnt
[12/6/16, 3:54:53 PM] Rahul: Yah
[12/6/16, 3:55:17 PM] Rahul: I found strings and pointers really hard at first but then I sat down 1 weekend and just did that then I got it
[12/6/16, 3:55:22 PM] Suyash: Here they give projects every 1.5 weeks - similar to capstone but for one topic. Really long, quite hard
[12/6/16, 3:55:27 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/16, 3:55:28 PM] Rahul: I haven't done that yet for structs etc
[12/6/16, 3:55:58 PM] Rahul: Dam bruh so many projects
[12/6/16, 3:56:10 PM] Rahul: That's tough
[12/6/16, 3:56:27 PM] Suyash: We had to make a game for classes, also need some artificial intelligence for computer
[12/6/16, 3:56:30 PM] Rahul: Cos in project extensive documentation also required right?
[12/6/16, 3:56:36 PM] Suyash: http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~forns/classes/fall-2014/cs-31/cs-31.html
[12/6/16, 3:56:53 PM] Suyash: This has a good review of all topics, and hard practice questions
[12/6/16, 3:56:59 PM] Suyash: What do you mean?
[12/6/16, 3:57:27 PM] Rahul: Oh ok
[12/6/16, 3:57:47 PM] Rahul: For us we need to write lots of stuff explaining reasoning behind the code et al
[12/6/16, 3:58:08 PM] Rahul: Code needs to be properly commented which is also a pain in the butt
[12/6/16, 3:58:10 PM] Suyash: Here just need comments - minimal
[12/6/16, 3:58:32 PM] Suyash: The problem here is that a computer script tests the code - and the cases are too damn extensive
[12/6/16, 3:58:49 PM] Rahul: The cases?
[12/6/16, 3:59:01 PM] Suyash: Test cases to score your code. Too many edge cases, exceptions
[12/6/16, 3:59:18 PM] Rahul: Oh ok
[12/6/16, 3:59:39 PM] Rahul: Here TAs test code
[12/6/16, 3:59:51 PM] Rahul: And grade it
[12/6/16, 4:00:04 PM] Suyash: Oh yeah even we need to write a report - TAs check that
[12/6/16, 4:00:05 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/16, 4:00:16 PM] Rahul: Yah
[12/6/16, 4:00:34 PM] Suyash: And they use Linux g++ compiler - which is very very prone to catching errors. Many times xcode will let it be (array out of bounds in a loop) - but you lose marks still
[12/6/16, 4:00:42 PM] Rahul: I actually found it a bit more interesting when we actually started using code to program real objects
[12/6/16, 4:00:59 PM] Rahul: Yes same we use Linux g++
[12/6/16, 4:01:03 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/6/16, 4:02:00 PM] Rahul: Bruh but when we started using Linux I found it a pain to remember the syntax for writing commands in the terminal window
[12/6/16, 4:02:08 PM] Rahul: There were like 100s
[12/6/16, 4:02:19 PM] Suyash: Here we just use XCode
[12/6/16, 4:02:23 PM] Rahul: But then I kind of figured which ones were used again and again
[12/6/16, 4:02:28 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/16, 4:02:55 PM] Rahul: Oh so u use XCode but the TAs grade using Linux?
[12/6/16, 4:03:13 PM] Suyash: The bot uses g++
[12/6/16, 4:03:22 PM] Suyash: But we code in xcode
[12/6/16, 4:03:34 PM] Suyash: And if need be, test on remote Linux server
[12/6/16, 4:03:34 PM] Rahul: Ah ok
[12/6/16, 4:03:53 PM] Suyash: http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs31/Projects/7/spec.html
[12/6/16, 4:04:01 PM] Rahul: We just coded in the Linux environment
[12/6/16, 4:04:05 PM] Suyash: This is the spec for the classes related project
[12/6/16, 4:04:09 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/16, 4:04:15 PM] Suyash: I'm screwed for maths
[12/6/16, 4:04:55 PM] Rahul: Dam bruh that's quite long
[12/6/16, 4:05:21 PM] Rahul: Ur project is definitely a bit more difficult than mine
[12/6/16, 4:05:28 PM] Rahul: Atleast lengthier
[12/6/16, 4:05:58 PM] Suyash: Yah this was the last one, so made it harder
[12/6/16, 4:06:11 PM] Rahul: That sucks
[12/6/16, 4:06:20 PM] Suyash: The next CS course projects are up to 8 times longer than this
[12/6/16, 4:06:34 PM] Suyash: You will take more CS yeah?
[12/6/16, 4:06:39 PM] Rahul: The thing about harder questions is that it sucks when u do it but u learn more
[12/6/16, 4:06:41 PM] Rahul: Yes
[12/6/16, 4:06:46 PM] Rahul: I more senester
[12/6/16, 4:06:50 PM] Suyash: Next should be data structures
[12/6/16, 4:06:57 PM] Rahul: Yes
[12/6/16, 4:07:11 PM] Rahul: And they also gonna teach stuff like somidworks etc
[12/6/16, 4:07:23 PM] Suyash: Yes thats good
[12/6/16, 4:07:23 PM] Rahul: Which used across engineering disciplines
[12/6/16, 4:07:42 PM] Suyash: I enrolled into an electronics related course - internet of things
[12/6/16, 4:07:42 PM] Rahul: Solid works is nice I like it
[12/6/16, 4:08:01 PM] Rahul: I've been messing around with it since we used it in a lab
[12/6/16, 4:08:11 PM] Suyash: Need to by parts etc - hopefully teach something useful like soldering etc
[12/6/16, 4:08:17 PM] Rahul: I never really understood what is Internet of things?
[12/6/16, 4:08:27 PM] Suyash: Me neither
[12/6/16, 4:08:31 PM] Suyash: Will find out next quarter
[12/6/16, 4:08:53 PM] Suyash: Shall ttyl, have Neuro final tomorrow. But need to do Math for day after!
[12/6/16, 4:09:02 PM] Rahul: Good luck
[12/6/16, 4:09:17 PM] Suyash: You too üëç
[12/6/16, 4:09:19 PM] Rahul: Bruh btw in second year I'm going to take a holography course!
[12/6/16, 4:09:29 PM] Rahul: It's gonna be lit
[12/6/16, 4:09:46 PM] Rahul: Anyway, good luck with exams , see u in Dubai
[12/6/16, 4:10:27 PM] Akshay: Haha udit I have an essay too
[12/6/16, 4:10:37 PM] Akshay: 10-12 pages, for sociology

[12/6/16, 4:14:21 PM] Suyash: At Dar Al Wasl squash courts!
[12/6/16, 4:16:21 PM] Udit: Is that Rahul s place?
[12/6/16, 4:21:02 PM] Rahul: Yes
[12/8/16, 3:35:15 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/8/16, 3:35:41 PM] Akshay: This is the coldest consistent temperature I've been in (as in, lived in for an extended duration)
[12/8/16, 3:35:59 PM] Akshay: Ofc in Switzerland on holiday, I was in -15 Celsius too
[12/8/16, 3:36:20 PM] Udit: Today after a long time the temp here 12
[12/8/16, 3:36:28 PM] Udit: U were in Switzerland?
[12/8/16, 3:37:08 PM] Akshay: Baba I mean when I had gone for holiday long ago
[12/8/16, 3:37:16 PM] Udit: Ooo
[12/8/16, 3:37:21 PM] Udit: My bad
[12/8/16, 3:38:13 PM] Akshay: üëçüèæ
[12/8/16, 7:32:33 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/8/16, 7:32:40 PM] Akshay: Today it's someone else
[12/8/16, 7:33:00 PM] Akshay: Tomorrow it might be me and my friend returning from tennis at night!
[12/8/16, 7:33:02 PM] Suyash: Damn
[12/8/16, 7:33:14 PM] Akshay: Tudor fieldhouse is within the campus that too
[12/8/16, 7:33:30 PM] Akshay: The tennis courts/football stadium etc are on the fringes
[12/8/16, 7:34:12 PM] Suyash: Here one Asian guy jumped off engineering building a couple weeks back. Found the suicide note at the entrance of the quad
[12/8/16, 7:34:39 PM] Suyash: At gun point would you fight, flight or give in?
[12/8/16, 7:40:38 PM] Akshay: Give in.
[12/8/16, 7:40:53 PM] Akshay: Rice uni police department clearly gives instructions
[12/8/16, 7:41:02 PM] Akshay: If someone threatens, first step is to give in
[12/8/16, 7:41:21 PM] Akshay: Don't fight until it's already too late and they're going to hurt you anyways
[12/8/16, 8:16:28 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/8/16, 8:16:40 PM] Suyash: I usually don't carry cash
[12/9/16, 6:05:18 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/9/16, 6:05:35 AM] Akshay: Kindly ignore yesterday's statement and consider today's!
[12/9/16, 6:20:50 AM] Sunil: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/9/16, 6:24:11 AM] Akshay: Wow Sunil.
[12/9/16, 6:24:25 AM] Akshay: Yes it got extremely cold over the last week
[12/9/16, 6:24:34 AM] Akshay: Good luck mate
[12/9/16, 6:28:35 AM] Sunil: Thanks
[12/9/16, 7:13:10 AM] Rahul: We have -5
[12/9/16, 7:19:07 AM] Akshay: Haha you're not in this conversation mate!
[12/9/16, 7:27:04 AM] Rahul: The conversation was finishedüëÜüèΩüòÑ
[12/9/16, 7:37:49 AM] Akshay: Lol true
[12/9/16, 1:37:22 PM] Rahul: Brrruhhhhhh.......
[12/9/16, 1:37:29 PM] Rahul: I have holiday homework
[12/9/16, 1:37:49 PM] Rahul: I have to read a business book and write a book review to my professor
[12/9/16, 1:44:38 PM] Akshay: Solid
[12/9/16, 2:24:08 PM] Rahul: Suyash, do u use the member operator in classes
[12/9/16, 2:24:30 PM] Rahul: I suddenly had that doubt while writing code in exam
[12/9/16, 2:25:08 PM] Rahul: This particular question was like fill in the blanks in an online quiz
[12/9/16, 2:25:33 PM] Suyash: :: one?
[12/9/16, 2:25:40 PM] Suyash: Or -> ?
[12/9/16, 2:25:46 PM] Rahul: No that's scope resolution
[12/9/16, 2:25:52 PM] Rahul: Yes the second one
[12/9/16, 2:26:05 PM] Rahul: Also replaced by . with pointer
[12/9/16, 2:26:12 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/9/16, 2:26:31 PM] Suyash: -> for pointers, . for members
[12/9/16, 2:26:43 PM] Rahul: In classes not struct - ru sure
[12/9/16, 2:26:56 PM] Suyash: Yes classes and structs are the same
[12/9/16, 2:27:03 PM] Rahul: Because this was like a function prototype was inside the class
[12/9/16, 2:27:10 PM] Suyash: Except for the default public / private definition
[12/9/16, 2:27:14 PM] Udit: I have to make a market plan for Cadbury
[12/9/16, 2:27:23 PM] Udit: So yeah.....
[12/9/16, 2:27:28 PM] Rahul: As in for real?
[12/9/16, 2:27:29 PM] Suyash: Lol
[12/9/16, 2:27:37 PM] Udit: Yeah
[12/9/16, 2:27:41 PM] Udit: For reals
[12/9/16, 2:27:47 PM] Rahul: Dam
[12/9/16, 2:27:48 PM] Udit: 3000 words
[12/9/16, 2:27:55 PM] Udit: Worth 70%
[12/9/16, 2:27:57 PM] Rahul: Bruh business is exciting
[12/9/16, 2:28:04 PM] Udit: As no written exam
[12/9/16, 2:28:08 PM] Rahul: We shud switch majors:)
[12/9/16, 2:28:18 PM] Udit: Tots
[12/9/16, 2:28:24 PM] Suyash: Rahul what happened to IBE?
[12/9/16, 2:28:33 PM] Rahul: I am in IBE
[12/9/16, 2:28:50 PM] Rahul: so they say it works - we r in certain classes together as a cohort
[12/9/16, 2:28:54 PM] Rahul: Every semester
[12/9/16, 2:29:01 PM] Rahul: This was the first one of those
[12/9/16, 2:29:28 PM] Rahul: In this class they taught some basic tools used by engineers
[12/9/16, 2:29:36 PM] Rahul: Like MATLAB, C++
[12/9/16, 2:29:58 PM] Rahul: Next semester we will be in a product design project together
[12/9/16, 2:30:26 PM] Rahul: And we actually have to make a value proposition for our product in front of some executives from industry
[12/9/16, 2:31:20 PM] Suyash: Sweet
[12/9/16, 2:31:31 PM] Suyash: So it's a mix of business and eng throughout right?
[12/9/16, 2:31:39 PM] Rahul: Yup
[12/9/16, 2:31:47 PM] Rahul: I basically minor in business
[12/9/16, 2:32:04 PM] Rahul: Honors classes all
[12/9/16, 2:32:20 PM] Rahul: And I also do the major version of the minor courses for business
[12/9/16, 2:33:26 PM] Rahul: So coming back to my doubt, there was a void function prototype in the class definition under public
[12/9/16, 2:33:50 PM] Rahul: Inside the function definition I had to print a data member of the class
[12/9/16, 2:34:34 PM] Rahul: I reasoned that since the void function was a member function of the class, it cud directly access a component of the class without the dot operator
[12/9/16, 2:40:48 PM] Suyash: Yes that's correct
[12/9/16, 2:41:36 PM] Suyash: this. is implicit in such cases
[12/9/16, 2:41:48 PM] Rahul: Thank god
[12/9/16, 2:42:17 PM] Rahul: Bcos there was no way of checking by compiling program
[12/9/16, 2:42:40 PM] Suyash: Yah it's on pen and paper right?
[12/9/16, 2:42:44 PM] Rahul: Since it was online quiz
[12/9/16, 2:42:46 PM] Rahul: Nah
[12/9/16, 2:42:53 PM] Suyash: Okay
[12/9/16, 2:42:53 PM] Rahul: All online
[12/9/16, 2:43:04 PM] Suyash: Thats good
[12/9/16, 2:43:10 PM] Suyash: Here its a 3 hr written slog
[12/9/16, 2:43:11 PM] Rahul: So there was a quiz section
[12/9/16, 2:43:17 PM] Rahul: Oh dam
[12/9/16, 2:43:23 PM] Rahul: For us only 2
[12/9/16, 2:43:29 PM] Suyash: But a lot of it is code analysis, MCQs
[12/9/16, 2:43:42 PM] Suyash: Code writing is mostly tested in the projects
[12/9/16, 2:43:58 PM] Rahul: Yah that's for us too
[12/9/16, 2:44:21 PM] Rahul: But ur exams/ projects seem to be more difficult
[12/9/16, 2:45:14 PM] Rahul: We have 20 point code writing - that was only functions easy shit
[12/9/16, 2:45:28 PM] Rahul: But the online quiz sections we tough
[12/9/16, 2:47:13 PM] Rahul: Thnx tho for clearing doubt!
[12/9/16, 2:47:28 PM] Rahul: Best of luck for remaining exams everyone
[12/9/16, 3:29:16 PM] Suyash: I finished my exams yesterday. Flying out tomorrow
[12/9/16, 3:29:27 PM] Rahul: Lucky
[12/9/16, 3:29:37 PM] Rahul: I am coming on 14th
[12/9/16, 3:29:51 PM] Rahul: Physics , math left
[12/9/16, 3:30:15 PM] Rahul: U also going India on 18th
[12/9/16, 3:30:35 PM] Rahul: My grandmom and uncle will be alone that time
[12/9/16, 3:30:41 PM] Rahul: So we fill in
[12/9/16, 3:31:03 PM] Rahul: My grandad passes away last month üòí
[12/9/16, 3:31:12 PM] Rahul: *passed
[12/9/16, 3:31:55 PM] Akshay: Oh sad to hear that. Hope your grandma is fine.
[12/9/16, 3:32:53 PM] Rahul: She's fine, but finding it hard to cope
[12/9/16, 3:33:27 PM] Rahul: I'll come back on 26 from India
[12/9/16, 3:33:44 PM] Rahul: Then leave on the 6th from Dubai
[12/9/16, 4:20:11 PM] Akshay: Ok. I leave on 6 also, I think.

[12/11/16, 9:08:29 AM] Suyash: Finals started the day after classes over, so that's why everything wrapped up early
[12/11/16, 9:08:49 AM] Sunil: I have two more finals left

[12/12/16, 9:29:00 AM] Akshay: Man for me it's freshman +3
[12/12/16, 9:29:10 AM] Suyash: Pounds or KG?!
[12/12/16, 9:29:25 AM] Akshay: Columbia core is not even GE, it's such a bad GE, you cannot even choose what to do
[12/12/16, 9:29:26 AM] Akshay: Pounds
[12/12/16, 9:29:42 AM] Akshay: I hope it's muscle
[12/12/16, 9:29:49 AM] Suyash: Lol
[12/12/16, 9:29:53 AM] Akshay: I haven't become visibly fatter hopefully
[12/12/16, 9:29:57 AM] Suyash: 3 pounds isn't much
[12/12/16, 9:30:00 AM] Akshay: Muscle weighs more than fat
[12/12/16, 9:30:08 AM] Suyash: I find it quite useless, even though US unis are known for general edu
[12/12/16, 9:30:18 AM] Akshay: 3 pounds of muscle will be much, but obviously I have gained some fat too
[12/12/16, 9:30:25 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/12/16, 9:31:26 AM] Suyash: I think US food has less fat ingredients overall - there I eat a lot more than here, but feel less full/bloated
[12/12/16, 9:36:38 AM] Akshay: Not possible man
[12/12/16, 9:36:45 AM] Akshay: I think you just moved more
[12/12/16, 9:36:54 AM] Akshay: US food has a lot of fat, I feel.

[12/13/16, 8:45:47 PM] Akshay: Idk how well they did but they finished
[12/13/16, 8:46:01 PM] Akshay: The exam was not as long in terms of pure writing as school exams
[12/13/16, 8:46:10 PM] Akshay: But the thinking needed for some questions was too much
[12/13/16, 8:46:30 PM] Suyash: Oh
[12/13/16, 8:46:40 PM] Suyash: It's curved yeah?
[12/13/16, 8:46:53 PM] Akshay: No
[12/13/16, 8:47:57 PM] Suyash: My 4.0 dreams have been shattered
[12/13/16, 8:48:05 PM] Suyash: Math A- ffs
[12/13/16, 8:48:13 PM] Akshay: Lol my 3.8 dreams have been shattered
[12/13/16, 8:48:16 PM] Akshay: Wanker
[12/13/16, 8:48:29 PM] Akshay: A- is still good man
[12/13/16, 8:49:35 PM] Akshay: I'm looking at C in chem, hopefully with generous curve A in physics, A in math, A in soci, I think B in Ceve
[12/13/16, 8:50:15 PM] Suyash: Chem x_x
[12/13/16, 8:52:12 PM] Suyash: The scale is the same at all unis yeah?
[12/13/16, 8:52:32 PM] Suyash: C is 2, B 3, A 4
[12/13/16, 8:53:39 PM] Akshay: Not sure
[12/13/16, 8:53:46 PM] Akshay: I think A is 4.
[12/13/16, 8:53:54 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/13/16, 8:54:38 PM] Rahul: I think I might pull a 4.0 this semester
[12/13/16, 8:54:48 PM] Rahul: I got an A in engineering
[12/13/16, 8:54:54 PM] Rahul: 93.67 percent
[12/13/16, 8:55:05 PM] Akshay: I thought you were messing up physics though
[12/13/16, 8:55:15 PM] Rahul: But that's the only grade that's come in so far, physics and math done today only
[12/13/16, 8:55:21 PM] Rahul: When did mess up physics?
[12/13/16, 8:55:27 PM] Akshay: 70/100 et al
[12/13/16, 8:55:40 PM] Rahul: Honors physics- every test I've been 15 points or so above average
[12/13/16, 8:55:56 PM] Rahul: When they curve it in the end I'll get an A
[12/13/16, 8:56:02 PM] Akshay: Ok
[12/13/16, 8:56:08 PM] Akshay: That's good
[12/13/16, 8:56:27 PM] Akshay: Physics I got 87&84 in two exams. Probably messed up the final, idk.
[12/13/16, 8:56:39 PM] Akshay: I think the curve will help me get A
[12/13/16, 8:56:51 PM] Akshay: Math I got 98&88- messed up the second exam
[12/13/16, 8:57:02 PM] Akshay: Final probably 90+ fingers crossed
[12/13/16, 8:57:07 PM] Suyash: Math I expected an A, but Asians were too good - made no silly mistakes
[12/13/16, 8:57:20 PM] Akshay: Chem don't even ask.
122,112,113/140
[12/13/16, 8:58:18 PM] Rahul: Dude ... we made a Christmas album in my suite
[12/13/16, 8:58:29 PM] Rahul: When u come to Dubai - consider buying it
[12/13/16, 8:58:37 PM] Rahul: Pretty good by bad standards
[12/13/16, 8:58:41 PM] Suyash: Mixtape?
[12/13/16, 8:58:45 PM] Rahul: Yup
[12/13/16, 8:58:51 PM] Suyash: Cool
[12/13/16, 8:58:54 PM] Suyash: üòé
[12/13/16, 8:59:12 PM] Akshay: Wtf is this bs man
[12/13/16, 8:59:22 PM] Suyash: My mom met your mom in the gym it seems - a new hobby for mother's whose kids are off to uni
[12/13/16, 8:59:48 PM] Akshay: Which gym?
My mother probably needs some motivation :")
[12/13/16, 8:59:50 PM] Suyash: ^Rahul
[12/13/16, 8:59:50 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/13/16, 9:00:05 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/13/16, 9:00:11 PM] Suyash: Woah epic :")
[12/13/16, 9:00:27 PM] Rahul: It legit looks bad ass
[12/13/16, 9:00:37 PM] Rahul: But when u hear it.......
[12/13/16, 9:01:10 PM] Rahul: I'll leave that as suspense for when we meet
[12/13/16, 9:02:53 PM] Rahul: But I feel sorry for moms man
[12/13/16, 9:03:09 PM] Rahul: My mom needs to find a lot of new things to do now
[12/13/16, 9:06:54 PM] Rahul: By the way to get an idea of how much hair I have now look at the cover
[12/13/16, 9:07:30 PM] Rahul: I've finally gotten to grow it like I wanted
[12/13/16, 9:11:28 PM] Suyash: Still reminds of that assembly in Grade 11 - Rahul with the hoodie and Khambatta!
[12/13/16, 9:12:11 PM] Rahul: That's like one o those moments when u just look back and ur like " wat tha fuck was that"
[12/13/16, 9:12:44 PM] Rahul: It seems so petty and a stupid thing to pick on in high school , looking back
[12/13/16, 9:12:54 PM] Rahul: Let ppl grow their hair when they have it
[12/13/16, 9:17:22 PM] Akshay: Life in general is petty and stupid man.
[12/13/16, 9:17:40 PM] Akshay: I'm in terrible mood now.
[12/13/16, 9:17:53 PM] Akshay: Reflecting on 2016- safely the worst yr of my life.
[12/13/16, 9:20:27 PM] Suyash: Stan was in 2015, tho.
[12/13/16, 9:21:31 PM] Akshay: Stan would have elevated my life above the normal.
[12/13/16, 9:21:38 PM] Akshay: April 1 was in 2016 though
[12/13/16, 9:21:45 PM] Akshay: Not just that
[12/13/16, 9:21:52 PM] Akshay: Whatever has happened since then
[12/13/16, 9:21:55 PM] Akshay: Mundane
[12/13/16, 9:22:00 PM] Akshay: Failure upon failure
[12/13/16, 9:22:03 PM] Akshay: Lack of brilliance
[12/13/16, 9:22:12 PM] Akshay: Not just academia which is bs imo
[12/13/16, 9:22:18 PM] Akshay: Everything
[12/13/16, 9:22:34 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/13/16, 9:22:36 PM] Akshay: Ok lol I should stop discussing this or we can go on for ever
[12/13/16, 9:22:40 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/13/16, 9:22:49 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/13/16, 9:23:05 PM] Suyash: Akshay you're done with exams yeah?
[12/13/16, 9:31:52 PM] Akshay: Yes
[12/13/16, 11:20:29 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/14/16, 2:43:39 AM] Rahul: I think he also does not believe in climate change
[12/14/16, 2:43:55 AM] Rahul: üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
[12/14/16, 2:49:08 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/14/16, 3:39:26 AM] Suyash: üòÇ
[12/14/16, 11:40:09 AM] Rahul: And that wasn't it
[12/14/16, 11:40:23 AM] Rahul: I landed 9:30 in JFK
[12/14/16, 11:41:11 AM] Rahul: I found out there was a 10:40 flight so I rushed to the ticketing counter to change my 4:30 ticket to the 10:40
[12/14/16, 11:41:24 AM] Rahul: But I only got there at 10:00
[12/14/16, 11:41:48 AM] Rahul: So then I try to go back to the duty free where I came out
[12/14/16, 11:42:21 AM] Akshay: Hahaha let me guess you are now waiting somewhere with nothing to do
[12/14/16, 11:42:29 AM] Rahul: But, once I've collected baggage and passed a certain point, u can't go back in without checking in to ur next flight
[12/14/16, 11:42:56 AM] Rahul: So I tried to sneak past the security guard stopping people from going backwards
[12/14/16, 11:43:00 AM] Rahul: But he saw me
[12/14/16, 11:43:23 AM] Rahul: So I was stuck till 1:30 with nothing to do , not even duty free
[12/14/16, 11:43:42 AM] Akshay: Ahh lols
[12/14/16, 11:43:49 AM] Rahul: 1:30 the check in opened and then I've been shopping since then
[12/14/16, 11:44:26 AM] Rahul: The plus side is I probably know JFK terminal 4 better than Dubai airport now
[12/14/16, 11:44:32 AM] Akshay: Good.
[12/14/16, 11:44:42 AM] Akshay: What on earth are you buying
[12/14/16, 11:44:50 AM] Rahul: Chocolates
[12/14/16, 11:44:57 AM] Rahul: Now I'm in Hugo boss
[12/14/16, 11:44:59 AM] Akshay: Lol rahul probably the only one of all of us that actually buys a lot at duty free
[12/14/16, 11:45:14 AM] Akshay: Every shop has branded, expensive stuff :")
[12/14/16, 11:45:15 AM] Rahul: I really like this sweater but Idk if I shud buy
[12/14/16, 11:46:20 AM] Rahul: There's also groceries and Dunkin donuts type of stuff though
[12/14/16, 11:46:27 AM] Akshay: Hmm. You're loaded, go for it.
[12/14/16, 11:46:33 AM] Rahul: Got a few things to eat from there
[12/14/16, 11:47:06 AM] Rahul: But the thing is ... it's time to stop using my dads money for cool stuff
[12/14/16, 11:47:18 AM] Rahul: Like I can imagine my first job
[12/14/16, 11:47:32 AM] Rahul: I probably won't be able to afford a 350 buck sweater
[12/14/16, 11:47:47 AM] Akshay: Definitely
[12/14/16, 11:48:20 AM] Akshay: Go to a bookstore if there is one
[12/14/16, 11:48:26 AM] Akshay: Usually a great way to spend time
[12/14/16, 11:48:32 AM] Akshay: Maybe buy one book
[12/14/16, 11:48:37 AM] Rahul: Like even if u manage a first job of 100K a year, that's about 8K a month
[12/14/16, 11:48:44 AM] Akshay: And make a list of other books you find interesting
[12/14/16, 11:48:49 AM] Rahul: Yah I probably go
[12/14/16, 11:49:03 AM] Rahul: Bookstore
[12/14/16, 11:49:11 AM] Akshay: The sweater that costs 350$ is probably not worth it in the first place man
[12/14/16, 11:49:26 AM] Akshay: Even if you were making 200k a year!
[12/14/16, 11:49:41 AM] Rahul: It depends bruh
[12/14/16, 11:49:52 AM] Rahul: How much spare dole u have
[12/14/16, 11:50:08 AM] Akshay: But the spare dole can be used in so many ways
[12/14/16, 11:50:16 AM] Akshay: Did you see this really painful video
[12/14/16, 11:50:18 AM] Rahul: Like?
[12/14/16, 11:50:43 AM] Akshay: Uploaded by a Syrian teacher from somewhere, minutes before the army was probably going to kill him
[12/14/16, 11:50:45 AM] Akshay: Sorry
[12/14/16, 11:50:51 AM] Akshay: Suddenly changed topic
[12/14/16, 11:51:11 AM] Rahul: Woah dam did u see news?
[12/14/16, 11:51:24 AM] Rahul: These days there is no happy news left man

[12/15/16, 9:37:32 AM] Rahul: When u guys come here , if it's in the evening we should go to creek walk
[12/15/16, 9:37:41 AM] Rahul: Cool place to just hang out

[12/15/16, 9:38:18 AM] Rahul: But there's a canal and a big arch bridge
[12/15/16, 9:38:48 AM] Rahul: And a waterfall which gives way only to water taxis in the canal
[12/15/16, 9:39:04 AM] Rahul: *canal walk not creek walk

[12/17/16, 10:22:50 PM] Rahul: Yah
[12/17/16, 10:23:02 PM] Udit: Ya ya
[12/17/16, 10:23:06 PM] Rahul: I still remember the day I woke up so excited
[12/17/16, 10:23:27 PM] Rahul: I thought sehwag would break record that day
[12/17/16, 10:23:45 PM] Rahul: He was on 300 something
[12/17/16, 10:24:22 PM] Rahul: Got out in the first 2 overs üò•
[12/17/16, 10:36:53 PM] Akshay: I think rahul is talking of sehwags 319- probably 2009
[12/17/16, 10:37:19 PM] Akshay: Because his 309 in Multan, 2004- you were probably too young to remember watching it
[12/17/16, 10:37:36 PM] Akshay: India is playing well right now.
[12/17/16, 10:49:15 PM] Suyash: Yesterday I watched a badminton match live, crowd was packed with Indians - to watch PV Sindhu. They were cheering at the end of a brilliant men's doubles match for this one to begin. She finally lost lol.
[12/17/16, 11:03:55 PM] Akshay: Ahh you mean on tv?
[12/17/16, 11:04:32 PM] Suyash: Nah there's a super series finals happening a Dubai
[12/17/16, 11:04:45 PM] Akshay: Oh wow that's special
[12/17/16, 11:05:06 PM] Suyash: Not much pomp etc like for tennis. Similar to squash
[12/17/16, 11:11:37 PM] Akshay: True
[12/18/16, 2:01:45 AM] ‚ÄéRahul changed their phone number to a new number. Tap to message or add the new number.
[12/18/16, 2:40:07 AM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/18/16, 2:47:11 AM] Suyash: üëå
[12/18/16, 5:10:37 AM] Akshay: Oh alright udit
[12/18/16, 5:10:53 AM] Akshay: That's good renewal/renovation
[12/18/16, 8:08:52 AM] Rahul: Do u guys want to play at 9 in the morning tomorrow
[12/18/16, 8:09:59 AM] Sunil: Won't be able to come
[12/18/16, 8:10:10 AM] Sunil: Want to get some sleep
[12/18/16, 8:24:22 AM] Suyash: Sunil welcome to the sun, mate :)
[12/18/16, 8:25:11 AM] Suyash: Down to play at 9 tomorrow
[12/18/16, 9:53:50 AM] Rahul: Let's play
[12/18/16, 9:54:13 AM] Rahul: Call me when ur here
[12/18/16, 10:19:57 AM] Suyash: üëç
[12/18/16, 10:20:06 AM] Suyash: How about 10 AM?
[12/18/16, 10:49:30 AM] Rahul: Ok
[12/18/16, 10:49:37 AM] Rahul: Any time is fine
[12/18/16, 11:17:46 AM] Akshay: Probably tough for me
[12/18/16, 11:17:53 AM] Akshay: I have tennis early morning
[12/18/16, 12:26:40 PM] Udit: Yeah me too
[12/18/16, 12:26:50 PM] Udit: My cousins cming
[12/18/16, 8:01:17 PM] Rahul: Court booked at 10 though whoever wants to come
[12/19/16, 2:54:27 AM] Udit: Anyone watching the match
[12/19/16, 2:55:49 AM] Udit: Karun Nair!!
[12/19/16, 3:05:17 AM] Sunil: I am
[12/19/16, 3:05:34 AM] Udit: That was gr8
[12/19/16, 3:05:40 AM] Udit: Declared at last
[12/19/16, 3:06:06 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/19/16, 3:12:04 AM] Rahul: It's lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit lit ^ infinity
[12/19/16, 3:12:24 AM] Akshay: Lol dude
[12/19/16, 3:12:34 AM] Akshay: Jadeja was initially acting dick
[12/19/16, 3:12:45 AM] Akshay: Kept taking twos instead of giving strike
[12/19/16, 3:12:55 AM] Akshay: I declare Umesh Yadav the hero
[12/19/16, 3:13:11 AM] Akshay: Doesn't know how to bat, somehow edged it for a single to get the dude on strike
[12/19/16, 3:14:28 AM] Udit: üòÇüòÇ
[12/19/16, 3:18:23 AM] Suyash: 303* wtf
[12/19/16, 3:19:20 AM] Udit: Ik!!!
[12/19/16, 3:20:20 AM] Suyash: Rahul, we thought they'll wrap up after he scores 200 - enough
[12/19/16, 3:20:41 AM] Akshay: Lol
[12/19/16, 6:36:44 AM] Akshay: How have your jet lags been
[12/19/16, 6:36:55 AM] Akshay: Man today I told myself I wouldn't sleep in the afternoon
[12/19/16, 6:37:35 AM] Akshay: Was reading a book after lunch, got intensely sleepy, especially to do with the hormones/enzymes/body clock or whatever
[12/19/16, 6:37:42 AM] Akshay: Impossible to be awake
[12/19/16, 6:38:29 AM] Akshay: So I slept at 3, with alarms at 4 and 4:30, also told my mother to wake me up when she got back home at 5 from wherever she went
[12/19/16, 6:39:23 AM] Akshay: Missed both damn alarms, my mother returned late because of some delay-and it turns out I woke naturally 10 mins ago
[12/19/16, 6:39:35 AM] Akshay: Now the night shall ofc be ruinedüòÇ
[12/19/16, 8:16:29 AM] Sunil: Oh damn that sucks
[12/19/16, 8:17:42 AM] Akshay: How are you Sunil
[12/19/16, 8:17:46 AM] Sunil: Even I felt very sleepy around 5, went outside for a walk to prevent myself from falling asleep
[12/19/16, 8:17:48 AM] Akshay: How was your flight
[12/19/16, 8:17:56 AM] Akshay: Haha good strategy
[12/19/16, 8:18:08 AM] Sunil: It was decent but a bit boring
[12/19/16, 8:18:21 AM] Akshay: Hmmm, did you fly direct?
[12/19/16, 8:18:28 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/19/16, 8:18:45 AM] Akshay: That's good, same here
[12/19/16, 8:18:59 AM] Akshay: Have you played much tt recently or not?
[12/19/16, 8:19:11 AM] Sunil: No man, not that much
[12/19/16, 8:19:26 AM] Sunil: But I'm planning to start playing from tomorrow
[12/19/16, 8:19:36 AM] Akshay: Nice
[12/19/16, 8:19:39 AM] Sunil: How's tennis going
[12/19/16, 8:19:53 AM] Akshay: It's good, started coaching again yesterday morning
[12/19/16, 8:19:59 AM] Sunil: Nice
[12/19/16, 8:20:14 AM] Akshay: My coach says my strength has improved
[12/19/16, 8:20:20 AM] Akshay: Consistency etc
[12/19/16, 8:20:24 AM] Sunil: That's great
[12/19/16, 8:20:30 AM] Akshay: But aerobic fitness needs work
[12/19/16, 8:20:38 AM] Sunil: Oh okay
[12/19/16, 8:20:46 AM] Akshay: In the sense,I played a lot there, but not much training as such
[12/19/16, 8:20:54 AM] Sunil: Same for me
[12/19/16, 8:21:03 AM] Akshay: So while I hit hard etc, I have to improve at moving, reaching the ball etc
[12/19/16, 8:21:12 AM] Sunil: I've got a tournament in January
[12/19/16, 8:21:21 AM] Sunil: Okay
[12/19/16, 8:21:40 AM] Akshay: Also, when you play points/matches with some other people in the absence of a coach, you get a lot of bad habits-because you focus on outcome, not technique
[12/19/16, 8:21:55 AM] Sunil: That's true
[12/19/16, 8:22:07 AM] Sunil: But on the other hand you get to experiment more
[12/19/16, 8:22:07 AM] Akshay: It's the same for tt surely
[12/19/16, 8:22:13 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/19/16, 8:22:28 AM] Akshay: Yes, you get to practice some weird skills that no coach would consider necessary
[12/19/16, 8:22:39 AM] Akshay: Like defence, slice
[12/19/16, 8:22:47 AM] Sunil: Yeah definitely
[12/19/16, 8:23:00 AM] Akshay: A lot of the time, at tennis, I play weird points to unsettle the opponent
[12/19/16, 8:23:46 AM] Akshay: I just drop the ball short, inviting an approach/volley. If I hit a short ball in practice, the coach immediately shouts "that's too short MAN"
[12/19/16, 8:24:16 AM] Sunil: Haha üòÇ
[12/19/16, 8:24:24 AM] Akshay: Lol modi, wished Karun Nair on hitting a 300
[12/19/16, 8:24:56 AM] Sunil: What a performance
[12/19/16, 8:25:04 AM] Akshay: Someone trolls on Twitter saying "if only PM Modi was as concerned about the poor ppl hit hard by demonitization"
[12/19/16, 8:25:35 AM] Sunil: Lol that's savage üòÇ
[12/19/16, 8:25:47 AM] Akshay: He played really aggressive at the end. If I was KL Rahul I'd be jealous, getting out on 199 and then seeing my teammate score a triple
[12/19/16, 8:26:20 AM] Sunil: Oh yeah definitely
[12/19/16, 8:28:18 AM] Akshay: But on the other hand, rahul has more 100s already, and is more established in the team
[12/19/16, 8:29:20 AM] Sunil: That's true
[12/19/16, 9:26:25 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/19/16, 9:26:29 AM] Akshay: Such specific research
[12/19/16, 10:26:49 AM] Udit: üòç *Have you seen this?* 158xa.com
[12/19/16, 10:27:43 AM] Udit: Bs like this
[12/19/16, 10:30:57 AM] Akshay: Man wtf udit
[12/19/16, 10:31:10 AM] Udit: üòÇüòÇ
[12/19/16, 10:27:44 PM] Rahul: Nooooooooooooo
[12/19/16, 10:27:54 PM] Rahul: I got an A- in physics
[12/19/16, 10:28:06 PM] Rahul: Term GPA 3.9
[12/19/16, 10:28:14 PM] Suyash: Epic
[12/19/16, 10:28:23 PM] Suyash: I got A- in G.E. ffs
[12/19/16, 10:28:27 PM] Rahul: Fuuuuuuuck man
[12/19/16, 10:28:39 PM] Rahul: Man but I'm feeling sad
[12/19/16, 10:28:50 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/19/16, 10:44:59 PM] Akshay: Rahul that's insanely good dude
[12/19/16, 10:45:07 PM] Akshay: I doubt I'm at 3.9
[12/19/16, 10:45:28 PM] Akshay: More like 3.6-3.8, imo. Not sure ofc.
[12/19/16, 11:14:05 PM] Suyash: Yes me too in that range
[12/19/16, 11:14:32 PM] Suyash: A- is the worst grade :")
[12/19/16, 11:15:16 PM] Suyash: Especially since it's so hard to get - it's a minute spectrum between B and A
[12/19/16, 11:15:28 PM] Akshay: How is A- worse than B
[12/19/16, 11:15:45 PM] Suyash: Not that way
[12/19/16, 11:16:00 PM] Akshay: You mean it might feel the worst
[12/19/16, 11:16:05 PM] Suyash: It feels worse - like getting 89.8 in boards :")
[12/19/16, 11:16:06 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/19/16, 11:16:14 PM] Akshay: Because it's good, but just less than excellent
[12/19/16, 11:16:21 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/20/16, 12:22:35 AM] Suyash: GPA confirmed, 3.82... Not bad
[12/20/16, 12:23:08 AM] Akshay: I hope I get that actually... Not bad at all.
[12/20/16, 12:23:53 AM] Akshay: 3.9, rahul, well done-that's more brilliant. We can all get 4.0 next semester, I believe. It seems like it ended well. Hopefully same for Sunil, Udit etc?
[12/20/16, 12:39:50 AM] Udit: Yeah
[12/20/16, 12:39:57 AM] Udit: My exams are in jan
[12/20/16, 12:40:03 AM] Udit: üò£
[12/20/16, 12:40:40 AM] Udit: Just for eco,  stats,  and acc
[12/20/16, 12:40:47 AM] Udit: Rest essays
[12/20/16, 12:40:58 AM] Akshay: Ahh right
[12/20/16, 12:48:48 AM] Sunil: I still haven't received all my grades
[12/20/16, 12:49:19 AM] Akshay: Me neither
[12/20/16, 12:49:56 AM] Akshay: Does the exact GPA, from first semester onwards, actually determine chances at grad school, jobs etc
[12/20/16, 12:50:13 AM] Akshay: I asked my parents, they're saying "good performance is necessary"
[12/20/16, 12:50:23 AM] Akshay: But not sure more than that
[12/20/16, 12:50:29 AM] Sunil: I don't think it is very essential but it's better
[12/20/16, 12:57:00 AM] Suyash: The only thing is that the first few sems will likely be your best
[12/20/16, 12:59:57 AM] Akshay: Hmm
[12/20/16, 1:00:06 AM] Akshay: Sometimes not, with GEs etc
[12/20/16, 1:00:32 AM] Akshay: Maybe more focused academic ventures, major related, can actually increase gpa later for some
[12/20/16, 1:51:01 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/20/16, 1:51:50 AM] Suyash: CS exam was before finals week, gave the result after GPA deadline... Now I know why :")
[12/20/16, 2:01:46 AM] Akshay: Woah
[12/20/16, 3:36:06 AM] Rahul: I never got when to use char and when to use const char
[12/20/16, 4:11:30 AM] Suyash: const is just protecting the variable - by saying it can't be changed ever
[12/20/16, 4:11:33 AM] Suyash: Like a constant
[12/20/16, 4:12:08 AM] Suyash: Rahul I'm sure you were able to trace that code?
[12/20/16, 4:49:26 AM] Rahul: What do you mean trace?
[12/20/16, 4:56:07 AM] Rahul: I understood the code if that's what u mean
[12/20/16, 5:07:00 AM] Rahul: Ur prof is a bad ass
[12/20/16, 6:34:44 AM] Akshay: Game to play tomorrow morning?
[12/20/16, 6:34:51 AM] Akshay: Tt/squash etc?
[12/20/16, 6:35:10 AM] Akshay: I haven't met any of you lads yet, and don't have tennis tomorrow
[12/20/16, 6:39:36 AM] Suyash: Rahul is leaving tomorrow
[12/20/16, 6:43:59 AM] Akshay: What time, rahul?
[12/20/16, 6:52:44 AM] Rahul: Leaving right now
[12/20/16, 6:53:03 AM] Rahul: Coming back 26th afternoon
[12/20/16, 7:05:27 AM] Akshay: Alright. Have a good trip.
[12/20/16, 8:30:13 AM] Akshay: Udit, shall we play at your place tomorrow?
[12/20/16, 8:30:22 AM] Akshay: Sunil/suyash?
[12/20/16, 8:35:15 AM] Suyash: Yup I'm down to play üëç
[12/20/16, 9:08:08 AM] Akshay: Alright let's decide on something by tomorrow
[12/20/16, 9:08:25 AM] Akshay: I'm going to sleep so earlyüòÇ
[12/20/16, 9:08:40 AM] Akshay: I avoided the jet lag-based afternoon nap today
[12/20/16, 9:08:56 AM] Akshay: Hence unable to be awake now.
[12/20/16, 9:56:38 AM] Udit: Yeah guys
[12/20/16, 9:56:42 AM] Udit: Sure
[12/20/16, 9:56:44 AM] Udit: Do cm
[12/20/16, 8:11:44 PM] Akshay: Shall we play at 10:30?
[12/20/16, 8:21:40 PM] Suyash: How about in the afternoon? Have some errands in the morning
[12/20/16, 8:41:02 PM] Akshay: Afternoon isn't good for me. My mother says there's some work to be done for visa or something
[12/20/16, 8:42:48 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/20/16, 8:43:40 PM] Suyash: Lol I'm going for the visa work rn, hence busy in the morning :")
[12/20/16, 8:43:46 PM] Rahul: It looks good doesn't it
[12/20/16, 8:43:57 PM] Suyash: üëç
[12/20/16, 8:44:04 PM] Rahul: U guys have to do something for visa?
[12/20/16, 8:44:05 PM] Suyash: Maybe you should go for a clean shave
[12/20/16, 8:44:25 PM] Suyash: Mine expires before I'll be back in the summer
[12/20/16, 8:44:30 PM] Suyash: Renewal
[12/20/16, 8:44:54 PM] Rahul: I just got a short term multi entry visa
[12/20/16, 8:45:11 PM] Rahul: Just do it through Emirates u can just call them
[12/20/16, 8:45:24 PM] Suyash: I'm extending my residence visa
[12/20/16, 8:45:25 PM] Rahul: They make visa and email it
[12/20/16, 8:45:35 PM] Rahul: For UAE?
[12/20/16, 8:45:42 PM] Suyash: Ofc
[12/20/16, 8:45:53 PM] Rahul: I just became a tourist
[12/20/16, 8:45:57 PM] Rahul: It's easier
[12/20/16, 8:46:27 PM] Suyash: True but you need to apply everytime right?
[12/20/16, 8:46:34 PM] Suyash: How long is it valid?
[12/20/16, 8:46:45 PM] Rahul: This one is for one month
[12/20/16, 8:46:59 PM] Rahul: But it barely took a day or two to get it
[12/20/16, 8:47:09 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/20/16, 8:47:10 PM] Rahul: And then they emailed it to me
[12/20/16, 8:47:17 PM] Suyash: Idk why parents want me to get this
[12/20/16, 8:47:46 PM] Rahul: Maybe for financial purposes?
[12/20/16, 8:47:58 PM] Rahul: Did ur dad get an allowance from company
[12/20/16, 8:48:05 PM] Rahul: For 2 resident kids
[12/20/16, 8:48:23 PM] Suyash: I don't know
[12/20/16, 8:48:50 PM] Suyash: I'm sure there is some jugaad, underhanded stuff - cuz they don't give visa after 18
[12/20/16, 8:49:07 PM] Rahul: Yup
[12/20/16, 8:50:02 PM] Rahul: It might even be possible......
[12/20/16, 8:50:33 PM] Suyash: Akshay what is the latest in the afternoon you can play till
[12/20/16, 8:50:33 PM] Rahul: I think they allow for some nominal fee

[1/18/17, 2:51:23 PM] Udit: Ohkay
[1/18/17, 2:52:20 PM] Rahul: Imagine the music literally 100 times louder than ur listening in the phone
[1/18/17, 3:31:54 PM] Akshay: Lol wtf is that dude doing this for
[1/18/17, 3:39:32 PM] Rahul: This is how it always is
[1/18/17, 3:39:54 PM] Rahul: Whenever everyone's awake
[1/18/17, 3:41:06 PM] Akshay: Ok
[1/18/17, 3:41:18 PM] Akshay: Drunk or sober?
[1/18/17, 3:41:58 PM] Rahul: Sober
[1/18/17, 3:42:04 PM] Rahul: Drunk is way worse
[1/18/17, 4:17:49 PM] Akshay: Ahh lol beware of your suitemates!

[1/19/17, 2:48:54 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/17, 2:48:54 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/17, 2:56:11 PM] Akshay: Tie
[1/19/17, 2:56:13 PM] Akshay: Lol
[1/19/17, 2:56:46 PM] Suyash: Seems fun
[1/19/17, 2:56:59 PM] Udit: Not bad
[1/19/17, 2:57:15 PM] Suyash: This is in your personal room?
[1/19/17, 3:18:33 PM] Rahul: No
[1/19/17, 3:18:39 PM] Rahul: Suite common room
[1/19/17, 3:18:49 PM] Rahul: How is it a tie
[1/19/17, 3:18:52 PM] Rahul: I won
[1/19/17, 3:19:21 PM] Rahul: The objective to get 0 not 301
[1/19/17, 3:19:55 PM] Akshay: So the other guy got 4 yeah?
[1/19/17, 3:20:06 PM] Rahul: No
[1/19/17, 3:20:22 PM] Rahul: It's like u personally have to get from 301 to 0
[1/19/17, 3:20:50 PM] Rahul: Do the points u get r subtracted from 301
[1/19/17, 3:20:56 PM] Rahul: *so
[1/19/17, 3:21:15 PM] Akshay: Yeah I understand
[1/19/17, 3:21:20 PM] Akshay: Ok
[1/19/17, 3:21:21 PM] Rahul: On each side we have written how many points each person has to get to win
[1/19/17, 3:21:29 PM] Akshay: Ah
[1/19/17, 3:22:08 PM] Akshay: But then, why is 5 the last number
[1/19/17, 3:22:20 PM] Rahul: But it gets very difficult in the end because if u overshoot, then u go bust
[1/19/17, 3:22:33 PM] Akshay: So he overshot?
[1/19/17, 3:22:40 PM] Rahul: Bust means u throw again next turn with same number of points left
[1/19/17, 3:22:50 PM] Rahul: So when I was at 5 I overshot twice
[1/19/17, 3:22:59 PM] Akshay: Then finally, did you get exactly five?
[1/19/17, 3:23:00 PM] Rahul: Then next turn I hit exact 5
[1/19/17, 3:23:05 PM] Akshay: Ahh nice
[1/19/17, 3:23:20 PM] Rahul: And then in his turn he overshot 1 so I won
[1/19/17, 3:23:29 PM] Akshay: I say the semester gets REALLY intense this weekend on.
[1/19/17, 3:24:16 PM] Akshay: So sometime next week, probably like Tuesday, I'll be swimming in work. 
Technically,I'm swimming in work right now, but lot of it is reading for next week so I don't feel the impact yet
[1/19/17, 3:24:30 PM] Akshay: How about you guys?
[1/19/17, 3:24:31 PM] Rahul: lol
[1/19/17, 3:24:35 PM] Akshay: Udit, how was exams
[1/19/17, 3:24:43 PM] Rahul: This semester is shaping up to be my easiest
[1/19/17, 3:40:30 PM] Sunil: My Senate will get intense soon
[1/19/17, 3:40:37 PM] Sunil: semester *
[1/19/17, 3:50:50 PM] Akshay: What's up with your autocorrect lol
[1/19/17, 3:51:13 PM] Akshay: That's the weirdest accidental autocorrect I've seen
[1/19/17, 3:51:27 PM] Sunil: I know, it's weird
[1/19/17, 11:32:09 PM] Udit: Hey
[1/19/17, 11:32:18 PM] Udit: My first exam is today
[1/19/17, 11:32:22 PM] Udit: üò¨üò¨
[1/20/17, 6:01:55 AM] Sunil: Good luck Udit
[1/20/17, 6:04:20 AM] Akshay: Good luck
[1/20/17, 6:23:10 AM] Sunil: Federer whooped berdych
[1/20/17, 6:23:15 AM] Sunil: In straight sets
[1/20/17, 6:32:09 AM] Akshay: Yup
[1/20/17, 10:05:10 AM] Udit: Thank guys
[1/20/17, 10:05:13 AM] Udit: It was gud
[1/20/17, 10:05:16 AM] Udit: üôÇüôÇ
[1/20/17, 10:12:23 AM] Sunil: Nice
[1/21/17, 12:03:41 PM] Akshay: Ive come to the tennis courts to watch rice vs Texas A and M match
[1/21/17, 12:03:51 PM] Akshay: "Biggest home game of the season"
[1/21/17, 12:04:03 PM] Akshay: The match is awesome
[1/21/17, 12:04:03 PM] Akshay: Rice somehow managed to win 2 out of 3 doubles sets
[1/21/17, 12:04:03 PM] Akshay: To get the doubles point
[1/21/17, 12:04:03 PM] Akshay: There are three separate sets of doubles,between three pairs of teams
[1/21/17, 12:04:04 PM] Akshay: The third set went to a tiebreak and rice players won 7-5
[1/21/17, 12:04:13 PM] Akshay: Now singles stuff will begin
[1/21/17, 4:15:45 PM] Udit: Kya baat hai
[1/21/17, 4:15:52 PM] Udit: Enjoy
[1/21/17, 4:30:13 PM] Akshay: Lol we lost
[1/21/17, 4:30:14 PM] Akshay: 4-3
[1/21/17, 4:30:33 PM] Akshay: Out of six singles matches (for six points), rice won two, lost four
[1/21/17, 4:31:02 PM] Akshay: When it was 3-3, the last singles was going on, it was the third set, the rice player lost 4-6
[1/21/17, 4:31:20 PM] Akshay: So ultimately we can summarize by saying that rice lost by one break of serve
[1/21/17, 4:31:30 PM] Akshay: One . Just one.
[1/21/17, 4:31:37 PM] Akshay: It was awesome to watch
[1/21/17, 4:31:58 PM] Akshay: Ahh Sunil tomorrow we shall be on opposite sides. Rice plays UT Arlington.üòä
[1/21/17, 4:35:29 PM] Akshay: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[1/21/17, 4:36:19 PM] Akshay: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[1/21/17, 5:01:13 PM] Sunil: Haha that's exciting üòÄ
[1/21/17, 11:25:13 PM] Rahul: Bruh I'm supporting M. Zverev to win Aussie open
[1/21/17, 11:25:29 PM] Rahul: He clapped on Murray
[1/22/17, 4:38:39 AM] Akshay: Woah I just woke up and saw
[1/22/17, 4:38:44 AM] Akshay: Wait lads
[1/22/17, 4:38:59 AM] Akshay: The one who is going to win now is FED
[1/22/17, 4:39:14 AM] Akshay: Man I don't get the point of guys like berdych and nishikpri
[1/22/17, 4:39:19 AM] Akshay: Nishikori
[1/22/17, 4:40:00 AM] Akshay: Nishikori is young, extremely fit etc. He allows a 35 yr old to come after six months no tennis and beat him in 5 sets. How is that supposed to happen
[1/22/17, 4:43:02 AM] Udit: U r not playing
[1/22/17, 4:43:06 AM] Udit: ?
[1/22/17, 4:43:08 AM] Udit: Akshay
[1/22/17, 4:43:29 AM] Akshay: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂
[1/22/17, 4:43:42 AM] Udit: Y not tho
[1/22/17, 4:43:56 AM] Akshay: With this kind of performance from Murray and Djokovic, I had a legitimate chance of winning
[1/22/17, 4:44:15 AM] Udit: Yeah ik!
[1/22/17, 4:44:38 AM] Udit: I mean even I would have won
[1/22/17, 4:44:50 AM] Udit: Like I just played three times in my life
[1/22/17, 4:44:59 AM] Akshay: Nishikori ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ ‡§≤‡•á‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•á
[1/22/17, 4:45:14 AM] Udit: Well..
[1/22/17, 4:45:21 AM] Udit: My exams are going on
[1/22/17, 4:45:35 AM] Udit: And how r u typing hindi so fast
[1/22/17, 4:47:37 AM] Akshay: Haha I'm getting used to it
[1/22/17, 4:47:50 AM] Udit: Y
[1/22/17, 4:47:54 AM] Udit: U in America
[1/22/17, 4:48:04 AM] Udit: Incase u have forgotten
[1/22/17, 4:48:06 AM] Udit: üòÇüòÇ
[1/22/17, 4:49:38 AM] Akshay: http://www.ausopen.com/mobile/en_AU/news/articles/2017-01-22/ao_expert_zverevs_oldschool_approach.html
[1/22/17, 4:49:47 AM] Akshay: A rather excited author...
[1/22/17, 4:50:15 AM] Akshay: Haha I just occasionally type in Hindi for the fun of it
[1/23/17, 10:28:20 AM] Akshay: I just overheard a hilarious exchange between two ppl at my lunch table
[1/23/17, 10:28:49 AM] Akshay: I'm sitting with some people I've seen before around Duncan and the neighbouring residential college, but I don't know them
[1/23/17, 10:29:52 AM] Akshay: Wilson: Hi Grant, you look sleepy.
Grant: Don't worry, I'm not sleepy, I'm just Asian.
[1/23/17, 10:30:04 AM] Akshay: üòâ
[1/23/17, 10:30:20 AM] Udit: Geeezzzzz
[1/23/17, 10:30:30 AM] Udit: Did that really happen
[1/23/17, 10:30:37 AM] Udit: üòÇ
[1/23/17, 10:43:34 AM] Akshay: Yes
[1/23/17, 10:44:01 AM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[1/23/17, 10:52:40 AM] Udit: Lol
[1/27/17, 6:16:19 PM] Sunil: Are you guys watching the Australian open finals?
[1/27/17, 6:16:27 PM] Sunil: I'm pretty excited
[1/27/17, 6:26:20 PM] Rahul: Yes
[1/27/17, 6:26:30 PM] Suyash: Me too
[1/27/17, 6:26:41 PM] Rahul: I don't think I'll watch this night's festivities
[1/27/17, 6:26:49 PM] Rahul: But I'll watch tomorrow's
[1/27/17, 6:27:06 PM] Suyash: Yeah ofc :")
[1/27/17, 6:27:46 PM] Akshay: It'll disrupt sleep for the , but who gives :")
[1/27/17, 6:27:48 PM] Rahul: I mean not being sexist but just that I don't support any women's players
[1/27/17, 6:27:50 PM] Akshay: The week*
[1/27/17, 6:28:11 PM] Akshay: I support Venus for this one
[1/27/17, 6:28:17 PM] Akshay: Always support the Udog
[1/27/17, 6:28:30 PM] Rahul: Then u shud support Federer
[1/27/17, 6:29:04 PM] Suyash: In terms of support, I think Nadal is underdog
[1/27/17, 6:29:31 PM] Rahul: But in terms of head to head fed is underdog
[1/27/17, 6:29:38 PM] Rahul: And also 4 years older
[1/27/17, 6:29:48 PM] Suyash: Yes
[1/27/17, 6:33:49 PM] Sunil: Yeah I agree with Rahul
[1/27/17, 6:34:00 PM] Akshay: Nadal is clearly the underdog
[1/27/17, 6:34:08 PM] Akshay: Last two years has changed the situation man
[1/27/17, 6:34:41 PM] Akshay: Fed is too fast, Nadal has lost some physical speed. His forehand doesn't have the same zip as 8 years ago
[1/27/17, 6:35:07 PM] Akshay: This isn't my saying-most commentators, analysts et al agree
[1/27/17, 6:35:24 PM] Akshay: Think of it-Federer has reached semifinals at least in all of his last five slams
[1/27/17, 6:35:54 PM] Akshay: Last one he didn't reach semi was Aussie open 2015-lost in 4 sets to Andreas seppi in the third round
[1/27/17, 6:36:16 PM] Suyash: This is probably the most hyped match in the last 3 yrs?
[1/27/17, 6:36:34 PM] Sunil: Probably yeah
[1/27/17, 6:36:40 PM] Akshay: Murray Djokovic end of last year was a bit more hyped than this though
[1/27/17, 6:36:46 PM] Akshay: Battle for no. 1 et al
[1/27/17, 6:37:02 PM] Akshay: Just maybe you guys didn't take interestüòÉ
[1/27/17, 6:37:28 PM] Suyash: Yup, this has gotten interest from viewers of both eras
[1/27/17, 6:37:29 PM] Akshay: But this tournament has revisited history
[1/27/17, 6:37:48 PM] Akshay: Sentimental value is more
[1/27/17, 6:37:56 PM] Sunil: Yeah definitely
[1/27/17, 6:38:08 PM] Akshay: Murray, Djokovic too robotic, too similar, too correct I guess
[1/27/17, 6:38:31 PM] Akshay: Federer too perfect and Nadal the only guy who can beat him!
[1/27/17, 6:40:13 PM] Sunil: Well put Akshay
[1/27/17, 6:43:42 PM] Akshay: But that's the problem for me
[1/27/17, 6:44:03 PM] Akshay: I don't support Federer even though I love his tennis because he's just too gifted, too good
[1/27/17, 6:44:17 PM] Akshay: When you look at him play, it's just waay too easy
[1/27/17, 6:45:05 PM] Akshay: Which is why, I go for Nadal. The guy has broken his whole body in the quest to beat Federer, and seems more like us, seems more human, more mediocre. More relatable.
[1/27/17, 6:45:21 PM] Suyash: I think Federer is the most talented, beautiful player - but Nadal is just athletically, mentally, physically the most deserving
[1/27/17, 6:45:31 PM] Suyash: Yup
[1/27/17, 6:46:08 PM] Akshay: I don't worry even about deserving as much. I admire struggle and I'm incredibly jealous of talented people
[1/27/17, 6:46:31 PM] Akshay: Don't get me wrong, Federer obviously works incredibly hard, but still
[1/27/17, 6:46:58 PM] Akshay: There's an air of nonchalance, as if he's saying "is this all you can hit me with" to each of his opponents
[1/27/17, 6:47:20 PM] Akshay: While for Nadal, (similar Murray) it actually looks always as if the opponent is better than them
[1/27/17, 6:47:53 PM] Akshay: Sunil, how's tt?
[1/27/17, 6:48:19 PM] Sunil: It's going okay mate
[1/27/17, 6:48:28 PM] Sunil: I've got a tournament coming up soon
[1/27/17, 6:48:54 PM] Akshay: Alright good luck
[1/27/17, 6:49:07 PM] Akshay: My tennis is improving but I absolutely suck at matches
[1/27/17, 6:49:09 PM] Sunil: Thanks
[1/27/17, 6:49:23 PM] Sunil: Oh
[1/27/17, 6:49:32 PM] Akshay: Lost the last one against my friend here 6-2,6-2. Too many errors, double faults
[1/27/17, 6:49:34 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[1/27/17, 6:49:42 PM] Akshay: Demotivating
[1/27/17, 6:49:43 PM] Sunil: Btw are you in the team?
[1/27/17, 6:50:10 PM] Akshay: And then you watch the God sent perfection of Federer on tv and realize how insignificant you are in this world.üò•üò¢
[1/27/17, 6:50:16 PM] Akshay: Club tennis
[1/27/17, 6:50:20 PM] Akshay: Team
[1/27/17, 6:50:26 PM] Akshay: Yeah.
[1/27/17, 6:50:41 PM] Akshay: Rice club tennis is inclusive
[1/27/17, 6:50:53 PM] Akshay: To be in the team, basically you have to be interested, come for practice etc
[1/27/17, 6:50:58 PM] Akshay: No need to be too epic
[1/27/17, 6:53:32 PM] Sunil: Oh okay
[1/28/17, 6:09:07 AM] Akshay: HBD Udit!
[1/28/17, 6:17:53 AM] Sunil: Happy birthday Udit!
[1/28/17, 10:48:13 AM] Rahul: Happy birthday udick
[1/28/17, 10:48:51 AM] Udit: Thnx guys!!
[1/28/17, 10:48:57 AM] Rahul: I didn't know it was but I just saw these texts and decided it wud be impolite not to wish
[1/28/17, 10:49:15 AM] Rahul: Because I need to play squash in summer holidays
[1/28/17, 10:49:52 AM] Udit: Ok that's polite enough to tell me
[1/28/17, 10:49:55 AM] Udit: Thnx mate
[1/28/17, 10:50:01 AM] Rahul: Ur welcome
[1/28/17, 12:05:44 PM] Akshay: http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/18570743/australian-open-far-more-line-australian-open-trophy-roger-federer-rafael-nadal
[1/28/17, 12:05:56 PM] Akshay: Everything we discussed yesterday is well conceptualized in this article
[1/28/17, 12:06:11 PM] Akshay: Come on Nadal!
[1/28/17, 12:08:03 PM] Akshay: This match is way too important for the legacy left behind
[1/28/17, 12:08:14 PM] Akshay: As one slam, it doesn't particularly matter
[1/28/17, 2:15:35 PM] Suyash: Happy Birthday Udit :)
[1/28/17, 3:04:13 PM] Rahul: Your first wish has not been granted
[1/28/17, 3:04:24 PM] Rahul: Hopefully your second also goes to waste
[1/28/17, 3:04:38 PM] Rahul: That course was mentally draining
[1/28/17, 3:05:05 PM] Rahul: The only thing keeping me awake is the prospect of getting screwed for not finishing homework
[1/28/17, 3:05:29 PM] Rahul: As in grade wise
[1/28/17, 3:05:46 PM] Rahul: And the tennis final
[1/28/17, 3:12:06 PM] Akshay: Damn
[1/28/17, 3:12:11 PM] Akshay: Whose wish not fulfilled
[1/28/17, 3:12:17 PM] Akshay: ?
[1/28/17, 3:46:42 PM] Rahul: Yours
[1/28/17, 3:46:46 PM] Rahul: Venus lost
[1/28/17, 3:53:41 PM] Akshay: Ahh true
[1/28/17, 8:13:58 PM] Akshay: Few hrs to go
[1/28/17, 8:14:12 PM] Akshay: I'm sleeping at about 11 pm Houston time, alarm for 2:30 :")
[1/28/17, 8:15:00 PM] Akshay: Roger and rafa should spin up a treat again
[1/28/17, 8:16:00 PM] Akshay: Strangely, Roger Novak and Rafa Novak have been way more exciting rivalries in terms of closeness. And way more matches too. This is only the 35th Fedal match, and its heavily lopsided to Nadal, but we love it for the stylistic contrast
[1/28/17, 9:05:14 PM] Akshay: Are you guys going to wake up for the match
[1/28/17, 9:09:51 PM] Sunil: Might not wake up that early
[1/28/17, 9:10:01 PM] Sunil: Maybe around 4
[1/28/17, 9:10:29 PM] Suyash: I have unfortunately fallen sick - since yesterday with flu. Shall try to be awake - probably watch in the lounge, not the viewing party
[1/28/17, 9:17:04 PM] Akshay: Ok
[1/28/17, 9:17:25 PM] Akshay: I'm planning to sleep now. Wake up around 3 to catch the match. Probably sleep again tomorrow morning
[1/28/17, 9:18:05 PM] Akshay: Ffs lots of hw, laundry etc to be done too
[1/29/17, 12:45:05 AM] Suyash: Hope y'all are awake rn!?
[1/29/17, 12:45:33 AM] Akshay: Yup!
[1/29/17, 1:00:15 AM] Akshay: That backhand was ominously great :")
[1/29/17, 1:12:42 AM] Akshay: Ffs
[1/29/17, 1:12:55 AM] Akshay: Federer too fast, too good, too much precision
[1/29/17, 1:13:05 AM] Akshay: This is what I meant when I said Federer is too fast
[1/29/17, 1:13:14 AM] Akshay: He's so aggressive, yet without mistakes
[1/29/17, 1:13:21 AM] Akshay: Takes the ball so early
[1/29/17, 1:13:24 AM] Suyash: Ffs
[1/29/17, 1:13:36 AM] Akshay: First set 6-4
[1/29/17, 1:55:41 AM] Akshay: Come on Rafa!!!!!
[1/29/17, 1:56:14 AM] Akshay: Nice set from both. Federer slightly unlucky/careless early on.
[1/29/17, 2:12:15 AM] Akshay: Are you lads watching?
[1/29/17, 2:36:10 AM] Suyash: Yup nadal looking slow
[1/29/17, 2:36:24 AM] Akshay: Federer has shackled him this set
[1/29/17, 2:36:31 AM] Akshay: Not allowing any long points
[1/29/17, 2:36:37 AM] Akshay: Which give Nadal momentum
[1/29/17, 3:37:16 AM] Akshay: Any thoughts, comments?
[1/29/17, 4:05:09 AM] Suyash: Insanity
[1/29/17, 4:05:13 AM] Suyash: Nadal too good defense
[1/29/17, 4:05:17 AM] Akshay: Absolute bs and insanity
[1/29/17, 4:05:19 AM] Akshay: My word
[1/29/17, 4:05:40 AM] Akshay: It's just ridiculously good
[1/29/17, 4:06:15 AM] Suyash: Fkkkk
[1/29/17, 4:06:20 AM] Suyash: Insane oint
[1/29/17, 4:06:52 AM] Akshay: Just mindblowing
[1/29/17, 4:06:56 AM] Akshay: Come on rafa
[1/29/17, 4:06:59 AM] Akshay: Yes
[1/29/17, 4:07:09 AM] Akshay: What a fucking amazing response
[1/29/17, 4:07:15 AM] Akshay: Come on
[1/29/17, 4:08:33 AM] Suyash: Shiit
[1/29/17, 4:08:30 AM] Akshay: Fkk
[1/29/17, 4:08:37 AM] Suyash: Ffs
[1/29/17, 4:08:37 AM] Akshay: No way
[1/29/17, 4:08:40 AM] Akshay: Man
[1/29/17, 4:08:41 AM] Suyash: Damn unlucky
[1/29/17, 4:08:54 AM] Suyash: Keeps hitting the edge of the net
[1/29/17, 4:09:00 AM] Akshay: This is where Nadal must come up
[1/29/17, 4:09:11 AM] Akshay: Nadal's mental ability is just too high
[1/29/17, 4:09:24 AM] Akshay: Hopefully Federer gets tight
[1/29/17, 4:09:29 AM] Suyash: Cmon
[1/29/17, 4:09:30 AM] Akshay: Yes
[1/29/17, 4:09:31 AM] Akshay: Cmon
[1/29/17, 4:10:22 AM] Akshay: Yes let's go
[1/29/17, 4:10:28 AM] Suyash: Brilliant
[1/29/17, 4:11:26 AM] Akshay: Lol looking at both of them, we both are probably more nervous :")
[1/29/17, 4:11:57 AM] Suyash: Fkkk
[1/29/17, 4:12:27 AM] Akshay: That's brilliant man
[1/29/17, 4:12:47 AM] Akshay: Nadal please mate, do something
[1/29/17, 4:12:55 AM] Suyash: üò±
[1/29/17, 4:15:11 AM] Suyash: Can't watch
[1/29/17, 4:16:04 AM] Suyash: Fuck man
[1/29/17, 4:16:06 AM] Suyash: Fuck life
[1/29/17, 4:16:05 AM] Rahul: Yeeeeeeedssssssss
[1/29/17, 4:16:12 AM] Rahul: Yes!!!
[1/29/17, 4:16:15 AM] Rahul: Come on
[1/29/17, 4:16:28 AM] Akshay: Deserves it. Magnificent champion. GOAT.
[1/29/17, 4:17:00 AM] Akshay: Lol Nadal will win French now. Nothing like some anger to get him up
[1/29/17, 4:18:04 AM] Akshay: If I was Federer, I would leave now
[1/29/17, 4:18:07 AM] Suyash: Nadal has to come back
[1/29/17, 4:18:11 AM] Suyash: For some legacy
[1/29/17, 4:18:14 AM] Akshay: Beating my greatest rival in a slam final
[1/29/17, 4:18:15 AM] Suyash: Ffffs
[1/29/17, 4:19:03 AM] Akshay: Unbelievable luck though
[1/29/17, 4:19:12 AM] Akshay: To win the first tournament after coming back
[1/29/17, 4:19:16 AM] Akshay: It's unfair even
[1/29/17, 4:19:25 AM] Suyash: All the net balls
[1/29/17, 4:19:31 AM] Suyash: The extra day
[1/29/17, 4:19:32 AM] Akshay: Chill man
[1/29/17, 4:19:45 AM] Akshay: Nadal is the last person who will think of such stuff
[1/29/17, 4:19:57 AM] Akshay: We are the ones regretting this
[1/29/17, 4:20:14 AM] Akshay: I think that's why Nadal, even in a loss, showed why he has 14 slams
[1/29/17, 4:20:27 AM] Akshay: The mental focus is ridiculous
[1/29/17, 4:20:50 AM] Akshay: Well, as for Federer, he is just too talented. God has destined him to be this epic
[1/29/17, 4:22:04 AM] Akshay: Its ten years since the last time Federer beat Nadal in a slam
[1/29/17, 4:22:19 AM] Akshay: Oh my bad... It's about 5 minutes :")
[1/29/17, 4:24:50 AM] Rahul: Are u guys watching the post match?
[1/29/17, 4:24:56 AM] Akshay: Yes
[1/29/17, 4:25:04 AM] Akshay: I have heard exactly the same speech by the same Asian man every year
[1/29/17, 4:25:32 AM] Rahul: How hasn't his accent changed living there
[1/29/17, 4:25:46 AM] Akshay: He probably doesn't live there ?
[1/29/17, 4:26:05 AM] Rahul: CEO he is CEO of Kia motors AUSTRALIA
[1/29/17, 4:26:13 AM] Rahul: *bro he is
[1/29/17, 4:26:45 AM] Akshay: Ok
[1/29/17, 4:27:08 AM] Rahul: It's weird
[1/29/17, 4:27:19 AM] Rahul: I have noticed my accent changing a bit now
[1/29/17, 4:27:45 AM] Rahul: It's a matter of survival
[1/29/17, 4:28:13 AM] Akshay: I can soften my accent too, but still not a much different accent
[1/29/17, 4:31:28 AM] Akshay: I feel Nadal looks better with short hair
[1/29/17, 4:39:02 AM] Akshay: For Fed fans, it's an absolute dream match
[1/29/17, 4:39:10 AM] Akshay: Fed-Nadal match
[1/29/17, 4:39:19 AM] Akshay: Amazing, tense match, 5 sets
[1/29/17, 4:39:23 AM] Akshay: And Federer won
[1/29/17, 4:39:39 AM] Akshay: For me, everything almost perfect
[1/29/17, 4:40:02 AM] Akshay: Except for a tiny detail-Nadal could have won instead of Federer!
[1/30/17, 7:48:04 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/30/17, 7:51:23 PM] Rahul: Focus on IBM not intended
[1/30/17, 7:58:46 PM] Sunil: Wow it's shocking
[1/30/17, 8:27:10 PM] Suyash: Woah
[1/30/17, 8:27:18 PM] Suyash: Rahul what is your expert analysis?
[1/30/17, 8:40:44 PM] Rahul: It's not going to get better
[1/30/17, 8:41:08 PM] Rahul: Tech companies shall do worse because of immigration
[1/30/17, 8:46:00 PM] Rahul: Not close to disastrous losses though
[1/30/17, 8:47:16 PM] Rahul: Hopefully it gets better a few weeks into trumps presidency
[1/30/17, 8:48:03 PM] Rahul: The size of the drop may only be because the Dow went up to more than 20000 last week
[1/30/17, 9:16:02 PM] Suyash: This may be good for us/Indians? Cuz foreign competition is reduced
[1/30/17, 9:34:28 PM] Rahul: Possibly
[1/30/17, 9:34:48 PM] Rahul: It doesn't seem like a permanent ban
[1/30/17, 9:49:49 PM] Akshay: In the long run, it's bad for everyone
[1/30/17, 9:50:01 PM] Akshay: If it becomes permanent or long standing
[1/30/17, 9:50:19 PM] Akshay: Because it's bad for the US economy itself
[1/30/17, 9:50:40 PM] Akshay: Forget Indians, if this keeps up, no one will need/want to come to US
[1/31/17, 9:03:56 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/31/17, 8:29:58 PM] Suyash: Damn
[2/1/17, 2:20:47 AM] Udit: True
[2/2/17, 5:20:42 PM] Rahul: Dudes does anyone know if Sreyas is ok?
[2/2/17, 5:41:40 PM] Suyash: Yeah he didn't take part, just saw before it got violent
[2/2/17, 6:09:11 PM] Rahul: Ok that's good
[2/2/17, 6:09:43 PM] Rahul: I just don't get the point of burning down your own campus because a white nationalist is going to speak
[2/2/17, 8:49:47 PM] Suyash: It was a separate radical group that got violent
[2/2/17, 8:49:54 PM] Suyash: Not sure if those were students
[2/2/17, 8:53:42 PM] Rahul: Ahh I see
[2/2/17, 9:06:54 PM] Akshay: Goodnight.
[2/2/17, 9:07:19 PM] Akshay: Sorry meant to write that to my parents... Well, goodnight!
[2/4/17, 10:05:09 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/4/17, 10:05:50 AM] Rahul: And does anyone know a good site to watch Dubai open in HD?

[2/4/17, 10:28:47 AM] Rahul: We start series on Monday
[2/4/17, 10:29:11 AM] Rahul: lol Sunil and me have had extremely similar math schedules last and this semester
[2/4/17, 10:34:58 AM] Sunil: Yeah Rahul
[2/4/17, 10:35:11 AM] Sunil: And probably next semester too
[2/4/17, 11:05:02 AM] Rahul: Yah
[2/4/17, 11:05:19 AM] Rahul: We will start and finish calc same time
[2/4/17, 11:12:09 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[2/5/17, 1:37:27 PM] Akshay: Have any of you become American enough to bother with the Super Bowl tonight?
[2/5/17, 1:37:40 PM] Akshay: It's happening in my home town :")
[2/5/17, 2:22:24 PM] Sunil: I might watch for some time lol
[2/5/17, 3:03:11 PM] Akshay: Rahul have you heard of anyone at OS called Mikael Torpegaard
[2/5/17, 3:03:24 PM] Akshay: He's the number 1 ranked D1 tennis player atm
[2/5/17, 3:03:48 PM] Akshay: I'm currently watching highlights of a Davis cup match from 2015- him vs nadal
[2/5/17, 3:04:09 PM] Akshay: Nadal won ofc, but torpegaard wasn't killed. It was 6-3,6-4,6-3 or so
[2/5/17, 3:19:55 PM] Rahul: Wat?
[2/5/17, 3:20:10 PM] Rahul: Torpegaard u say?
[2/5/17, 3:20:26 PM] Rahul: I don't know shit about OS tennis still
[2/5/17, 3:20:35 PM] Rahul: Dam that's pretty good
[2/5/17, 3:22:01 PM] Akshay: Yeah
[2/5/17, 3:30:01 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/5/17, 3:30:12 PM] Akshay: Lol they're doing a "super bowl watch party"
[2/5/17, 3:30:29 PM] Akshay: I'm eating dinner though, this is the commons/dining hall
[2/5/17, 3:30:59 PM] Akshay: Saw one boy standing up while the song was playing-asked him why-he's like "it's the national anthem you idiot"
[2/5/17, 3:32:05 PM] Udit: U having dinner now?!
[2/5/17, 3:32:12 PM] Udit: Isn't it a bit early
[2/5/17, 3:32:22 PM] Akshay: Yeah this is the average dinner time in US
[2/5/17, 3:32:32 PM] Akshay: 5:30-7 the servery serves dinner
[2/5/17, 3:32:33 PM] Udit: I mean even I had now
[2/5/17, 3:32:36 PM] Udit: ....
[2/5/17, 3:32:41 PM] Akshay: Lol

[2/5/17, 3:32:51 PM] Udit: Oh wait
[2/5/17, 3:33:01 PM] Akshay: We have meal plan mate
[2/5/17, 3:33:03 PM] Akshay: That's why
[2/5/17, 3:33:06 PM] Udit: I am going for the entrepreneurship comp
[2/5/17, 3:33:22 PM] Udit: Any ideas for earning 1000 pounds in two weeks
[2/5/17, 3:33:34 PM] Udit: ?!?!
[2/5/17, 3:33:43 PM] Akshay: Sell everything you have

[2/5/17, 3:33:59 PM] Udit: Profit 1000
[2/5/17, 3:34:23 PM] Udit: Help me if u have any ideas
[2/5/17, 3:35:07 PM] Akshay: Does it have to be just simple stuff or technology based, innovative
[2/5/17, 3:35:23 PM] Udit: Anything
[2/5/17, 3:35:32 PM] Udit: Legal
[2/5/17, 3:35:48 PM] Akshay: Suyash may attest to the idea of selling posters etc
[2/5/17, 3:35:55 PM] Akshay: Don't know if that's good
[2/5/17, 3:36:11 PM] Udit: Hmm it is actually really gud
[2/5/17, 3:36:20 PM] Udit: But 1000 in two weeks
[2/5/17, 3:36:22 PM] Akshay: Try setting up an indian restaurant with chaat :")
[2/5/17, 3:36:23 PM] Udit: Is it possible

[2/5/17, 3:39:25 PM] Akshay: Alright
[2/5/17, 3:39:37 PM] Akshay: Basically nothing will be sold for under a pound
[2/5/17, 3:39:54 PM] Udit: 5++
[2/5/17, 3:40:00 PM] Akshay: Already you're making profit because it doesn't exactly cost a pound to make a plate of pani puri
[2/5/17, 3:40:04 PM] Udit: There few shops far
[2/5/17, 3:40:06 PM] Akshay: To the best of my knowledge
[2/5/17, 3:40:19 PM] Udit: Selling bhel for 6-7
[2/5/17, 3:40:30 PM] Udit: And it's always full
[2/5/17, 3:54:57 PM] Akshay: Yup
[2/6/17, 4:18:55 PM] Rahul: Guys search "FEH" on urban dictionary
[2/6/17, 4:20:54 PM] Udit: I think everyone knows what that means
[2/6/17, 4:21:08 PM] Rahul: What?
[2/6/17, 4:21:28 PM] Udit: Fuk them hoes
[2/6/17, 4:21:30 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[2/6/17, 4:21:50 PM] Rahul: I'm not talking about that
[2/6/17, 4:21:55 PM] Rahul: Just try it
[2/6/17, 4:21:57 PM] Udit: I mean atleast here people use that in chat
[2/6/17, 4:22:03 PM] Udit: Ok
[2/6/17, 4:22:15 PM] Rahul: And see the second thing that pops up below fuck em hoes
[2/6/17, 4:22:34 PM] Udit: The example üòÇ

[2/6/17, 4:22:58 PM] Udit: Yeah yeah
[2/6/17, 4:23:31 PM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/6/17, 4:23:32 PM] Udit: ...
[2/6/17, 4:23:43 PM] Rahul: Yes
[2/6/17, 4:23:44 PM] Udit: I prefer the 1st abbreviation
[2/6/17, 4:24:01 PM] Rahul: Ok
[2/6/17, 4:24:28 PM] Akshay: Lolol rahul
[2/6/17, 4:24:46 PM] Rahul: I don't know who did it
[2/6/17, 4:24:50 PM] Akshay: Feh mate :")
[2/6/17, 4:25:17 PM] Akshay: Want to combine the two
[2/6/17, 4:25:57 PM] Akshay: Feh-Fuk Exams and Homework
[2/6/17, 4:26:06 PM] Akshay: Fuk Engineering Homework
[2/6/17, 4:26:10 PM] Rahul: Lolol
[2/6/17, 5:05:59 PM] Suyash: Lolol Rahul rekt
[2/6/17, 5:07:48 PM] Suyash: I'm feeling my Gpa plunge for the first time. Barely median for Math and CS
[2/6/17, 5:08:01 PM] Rahul: What math ru taking?
[2/6/17, 5:08:06 PM] Suyash: Physics absolutely gone
[2/6/17, 5:08:18 PM] Suyash: Multi Integration
[2/6/17, 5:08:18 PM] Rahul: Here calc 2 is a free ride
[2/6/17, 5:08:26 PM] Rahul: Ahh calc 3?
[2/6/17, 5:09:26 PM] Suyash: Yes
[2/6/17, 5:09:40 PM] Rahul: Dude for me this semester best
[2/6/17, 5:09:51 PM] Rahul: 97 first math midterm
[2/6/17, 5:10:06 PM] Suyash: Sick
[2/6/17, 5:10:15 PM] Rahul: Average low 70s I think
[2/6/17, 5:10:25 PM] Suyash: Here I got 90, but median was like 86
[2/6/17, 5:10:28 PM] Rahul: But physics just seems easier now
[2/6/17, 5:10:33 PM] Suyash: CS I got dot median
[2/6/17, 5:10:44 PM] Suyash: Physics I'm fearing the worst
[2/6/17, 5:10:50 PM] Rahul: lol because UCLA lots of smart asians
[2/6/17, 5:11:00 PM] Suyash: Nah I'd say I made silly errors
[2/6/17, 5:11:17 PM] Suyash: But generally I've been lacking academic finesse this time
[2/6/17, 5:11:57 PM] Rahul: Don't get freaked out by physics man
[2/6/17, 5:12:19 PM] Rahul: Just sit down one day study 20 hours, after that it'll all be easy
[2/6/17, 5:12:22 PM] Suyash: Mostly because all the math, physics is BS compared to CS - that stuff is super crucial, the things we're learning now is pretty much enough to get a job.
[2/6/17, 5:12:27 PM] Suyash: Lol
[2/6/17, 5:12:34 PM] Rahul: Serious
[2/6/17, 5:12:41 PM] Suyash: That will be done before the final, hopefully
[2/6/17, 5:12:47 PM] Rahul: Like u remember how freaked out I was in physics
[2/6/17, 5:13:00 PM] Rahul: I sat down before final, 21 hours straight
[2/6/17, 5:13:07 PM] Rahul: The average was 98/150
[2/6/17, 5:13:11 PM] Rahul: I got 131
[2/6/17, 5:13:13 PM] Suyash: Woah
[2/6/17, 5:14:17 PM] Rahul: I think I wrecked the final exam curve
[2/6/17, 5:14:23 PM] Rahul: Or maybe I even set it
[2/6/17, 5:14:40 PM] Rahul: But I still got A- because of the BS I did on the homeworks
[2/6/17, 5:14:52 PM] Suyash: Ahh lol
[2/6/17, 5:15:20 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/7/17, 1:56:24 PM] Akshay: Damn I got B- on my fwis essay
[2/7/17, 1:56:39 PM] Akshay: I feel the grading was insane
[2/7/17, 1:57:26 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/7/17, 2:03:58 PM] Suyash: Shite
[2/7/17, 2:04:19 PM] Suyash: CS I got 48/100 on a HW - because in one place I used () instead of []
[2/7/17, 2:04:49 PM] Suyash: That caused the program to not compile even, and so 0 on all the test cases for the entire problem
[2/7/17, 2:05:05 PM] Suyash: Luckily it's only 4% of the final grade
[2/7/17, 2:08:09 PM] Akshay: Ohoh
[2/7/17, 2:08:50 PM] Akshay: Here this B- is half of one third of 75% of the grade
[2/7/17, 2:09:28 PM] Akshay: Because 10% attendance, 15% class presentation(on March 7) , 75% for three papers
[2/7/17, 2:09:33 PM] Akshay: Third paper is 25%
[2/7/17, 2:09:47 PM] Akshay: First and second papers will be written twice, based on same topic
[2/7/17, 2:10:13 PM] Akshay: And the grade for first two papers will be an average of the grade given to the first attempt and the second attempt
[2/7/17, 2:10:23 PM] Akshay: So half of a third of 75%
[2/7/17, 2:10:37 PM] Akshay: Which is 12.5%
[2/7/17, 2:10:40 PM] Akshay: Yup
[2/7/17, 2:16:26 PM] Rahul: Didn't the compiler spot the error for u tho
[2/7/17, 11:38:07 PM] Suyash: It had a type definition, so that any type can be used throughout. Sadly my testing was with primitive types like int - which strangely still work with the mistake. But string did not
[2/8/17, 1:48:15 PM] Akshay: My sister has been included in the dean's list at Columbia for Fall 2016.
[2/8/17, 1:49:00 PM] Suyash: Brilliant
[2/8/17, 1:49:11 PM] Akshay: The ivy dream... Sadly not for anyone in this group. üòñ
[2/8/17, 1:49:17 PM] Suyash: What was her GPA?
[2/8/17, 1:49:32 PM] Akshay: Not sure, let me ask
[2/8/17, 1:49:40 PM] Akshay: I know she didn't get any B
[2/8/17, 1:49:51 PM] Akshay: Probably an A- somewhere though
[2/8/17, 1:50:13 PM] Akshay: Does anyone know what a dean's list is?
[2/8/17, 1:50:16 PM] Akshay: What is it
[2/8/17, 1:50:37 PM] Akshay: I just saw some picture of the email she got saying "congrats, you've been included" et al
[2/8/17, 1:50:56 PM] Suyash: Just a form of achievement. Even here they have, anyone above a GPA cutoff and a minimum number of units
[2/8/17, 1:51:05 PM] Suyash: Usually 3.7+ is included
[2/8/17, 1:51:21 PM] Akshay: Ahh alright. Purely academic then.
[2/8/17, 1:51:46 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/17, 1:51:59 PM] Akshay: This is the classroom in which I do accounting in the business school at Rice
[2/8/17, 1:52:18 PM] Akshay: Do Ucla, Manchester, OS rooms look similar?
[2/8/17, 1:52:30 PM] Akshay: And ofc UTA,Sunil?
[2/8/17, 1:54:00 PM] Suyash: Here classrooms are pretty plain
[2/8/17, 1:54:28 PM] Akshay: Even at Rice, I feel this classroom looks really good because it's in the B school
[2/8/17, 1:54:33 PM] Akshay: Rich, newish, posh
[2/8/17, 1:54:43 PM] Akshay: Other rooms are pretty old
[2/8/17, 1:55:07 PM] Suyash: Yeah even here bSchool is the best
[2/8/17, 1:56:03 PM] Akshay: Fun fact-today in Sewall Hall 301, a 200 seater auditorium in which I have differential eq class (class has about 80 I guess), the chair I was sitting on broke halfway through the class
[2/8/17, 1:56:13 PM] Akshay: It was damn weird for me lol
[2/8/17, 1:56:23 PM] Akshay: I hurt my neck a bit in the fall
[2/8/17, 1:56:51 PM] Akshay: Incidentally, seat next to me was already broken
[2/8/17, 1:57:21 PM] Suyash: Lolol
[2/8/17, 1:57:38 PM] Suyash: This is the kind of stuff that happened in school audi
[2/8/17, 1:58:22 PM] Akshay: Yup
[2/8/17, 1:58:43 PM] Akshay: It is an embarrassment though.
[2/8/17, 1:59:24 PM] Akshay: Firstly, it hurts. Second, you disrupt the class, Asian teacher gets pissed because he forgets his chain of thought.
[2/8/17, 2:02:15 PM] Suyash: Damn
[2/8/17, 2:22:48 PM] Sunil: Congrats to her
[2/8/17, 2:35:19 PM] Rahul: Here it looks same
[2/8/17, 2:35:24 PM] Rahul: The classrooms
[2/8/17, 2:35:32 PM] Rahul: Congrats to your sister
[2/8/17, 2:45:19 PM] Sunil: Yeah same here
[2/8/17, 2:47:34 PM] Rahul: I'm pretty sure though all of us will be in dean's list at respective units
[2/8/17, 2:47:38 PM] Rahul: *unis
[2/8/17, 2:48:22 PM] Rahul: For me it's easy like 3.5 or 3.6 or something like that
[2/8/17, 2:49:44 PM] Rahul: *classrooms at OS similarly designed but bigger
[2/8/17, 2:50:38 PM] Rahul: Is it the case for u all that the business skool is the best looking
[2/8/17, 2:50:58 PM] Rahul: Bcos here it's completely new
[2/8/17, 2:51:12 PM] Rahul: So the B skool is almost like a town within the uni
[2/8/17, 2:51:19 PM] Rahul: Ultra modern looking
[2/8/17, 2:52:57 PM] Rahul: And they have like tunnels connecting all buildings and shit
[2/8/17, 3:14:27 PM] Akshay: Yup
[2/8/17, 3:14:35 PM] Akshay: But here everything is much smaller ofc
[2/8/17, 3:14:56 PM] Akshay: At rice the biggest lecture halls seem to be among the oldest too
[2/8/17, 3:15:17 PM] Akshay: Like the one I had physics last semester, was quite big
[2/8/17, 3:15:28 PM] Akshay: Again, definitely smaller than OS!
[2/8/17, 3:28:24 PM] Rahul: Lol dude I just found out I made the deans list
[2/8/17, 3:28:51 PM] Rahul: I just remembered this and checked my academic transcript and it's there
[2/8/17, 3:31:54 PM] Suyash: Lol well done
[2/8/17, 3:29:28 PM] Rahul: I must have got a mail and accidentally deleted it thinking it was some diversity mail or some shit
[2/8/17, 3:29:44 PM] Rahul: Because they've been sending those regularly since December
[2/8/17, 3:30:46 PM] Udit: Congrats!!
[2/8/17, 3:31:13 PM] Udit: And here I haven't yet gotten my 1st semester results
[2/8/17, 3:31:22 PM] Udit: üò¨üò¨
[2/8/17, 3:31:26 PM] Rahul: Lol when do u get them?
[2/8/17, 3:31:36 PM] Udit: Probably end of feb
[2/8/17, 3:32:19 PM] Udit: Well it's same for everyone in UK
[2/8/17, 3:32:30 PM] Udit: Except people in Warwick
[2/8/17, 3:32:38 PM] Udit: THEY DON'T HAVE EXAMS
[2/8/17, 3:32:46 PM] Udit: wtf
[2/8/17, 3:33:00 PM] Suyash: Yeah lol UK
[2/8/17, 3:33:07 PM] Suyash: You have one day for sports yeah?
[2/8/17, 3:33:13 PM] Udit: Nope
[2/8/17, 3:33:33 PM] Udit: Now I have on an avg 6hrs a day
[2/8/17, 3:33:44 PM] Suyash: Damn
[2/8/17, 3:34:14 PM] Suyash: Physics 1A mechanics is getting fucked up. We're using the stuff in multivariate integration here. Atleast half the class hasn't even done Muti yet
[2/8/17, 3:34:38 PM] Udit: Well Ttyl
[2/8/17, 3:34:41 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[2/8/17, 3:34:49 PM] Rahul: But it's like ... u can kind of mug it up
[2/8/17, 3:34:54 PM] Rahul: U know wat I'm saying
[2/8/17, 3:35:25 PM] Rahul: Ike in physics, THE WAY to do the proof can usually be learned through practice / reading till u faint
[2/8/17, 3:35:54 PM] Rahul: It's like mathematical intuition is developed over the years through practice
[2/8/17, 3:39:23 PM] Suyash: Yes
[2/8/17, 3:40:02 PM] Suyash: Lol the TA - totally asian guy - simply wrote on the board. Don't believe in your intuition, only believe in Math - after a pulley problem
[2/8/17, 3:40:16 PM] Rahul: Lololololol
[2/8/17, 3:41:05 PM] Rahul: Can u send a pic
[2/8/17, 3:41:14 PM] Rahul: If ur pulley problems
[2/8/17, 3:43:57 PM] Rahul: *of
[2/8/17, 3:44:01 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/17, 3:44:05 PM] Suyash: My bad
[2/8/17, 3:44:18 PM] Suyash: Question is relation between a1, a2 and a3
[2/8/17, 3:44:27 PM] Suyash: Not mass, accelerations
[2/8/17, 3:45:09 PM] Suyash: Our prof doesn't believe in using numbers for physics, every question is symbolic - same case for you guys?
[2/8/17, 3:45:27 PM] Rahul: Lol same
[2/8/17, 3:45:48 PM] Rahul: If u don't get a symbolic answer before plugging in u lose like half the points
[2/8/17, 3:45:56 PM] Suyash: Damn
[2/8/17, 3:46:26 PM] Suyash: This was a sub problem for which he wanted us to only believe in math, not use much intuition
[2/8/17, 3:47:34 PM] Suyash: I will buy you coffee in Dubai, if you can solve - some incentive to waste your time on this :")
[2/8/17, 3:49:12 PM] Rahul: Dude even this pulley stuff once u get its easy
[2/8/17, 3:49:30 PM] Rahul: The stuff I'll do in a month, all the thermodynamics shit that's so hard
[2/8/17, 3:49:45 PM] Rahul: Lol - first semester memories....
[2/8/17, 3:49:59 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/17, 3:50:15 PM] Rahul: The group MT for 12 points
[2/8/17, 3:50:22 PM] Rahul: Then came the individual
[2/8/17, 3:50:30 PM] Rahul: It was like a horror movie
[2/8/17, 3:50:38 PM] Rahul: They fucked with our minds
[2/8/17, 3:51:10 PM] Rahul: We went in there expecting thatüëÜüèΩagain
[2/8/17, 3:51:22 PM] Rahul: And we got axed
[2/8/17, 3:51:26 PM] Suyash: Lololol
[2/8/17, 3:52:04 PM] Suyash: Group Mt seems fun
[2/8/17, 3:52:21 PM] Rahul: I think someone looked up the indi MT questions
[2/8/17, 3:52:32 PM] Rahul: Found them in past Harvard and MIT physics papers
[2/8/17, 3:52:56 PM] Rahul: Oh yeah group is like u finish the sum in 15 mins and chill for rest 40
[2/8/17, 3:53:08 PM] Rahul: It's like for dum ppl to score points
[2/8/17, 3:53:44 PM] Rahul: Free which I decided to download MIT physics book chapters from online
[2/8/17, 3:53:54 PM] Rahul: *after
[2/8/17, 3:54:12 PM] Rahul: And study from there
[2/8/17, 3:56:45 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/17, 3:56:46 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/8/17, 4:03:00 PM] Rahul: And I think the way to do the pulley problems is to just sum the length of the rope
[2/8/17, 4:03:14 PM] Rahul: It will be variable plus some constant lengths
[2/8/17, 4:03:35 PM] Rahul: Differentiate wrt to t
[2/8/17, 4:03:57 PM] Rahul: That will give velocity of moving blocks
[2/8/17, 4:04:04 PM] Rahul: Diff again for acceleration
[2/8/17, 4:07:24 PM] Rahul: The key is that the total length of rope remains constant
[2/8/17, 4:25:15 PM] Suyash: Yes, nice. I didn't know that technique
[2/8/17, 4:25:21 PM] Suyash: Wow thanks for the sheet
[2/9/17, 5:54:19 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/9/17, 5:54:34 AM] Akshay: It seems this is the present state of the weather in NYC
[2/9/17, 5:54:47 AM] Udit: Whoa
[2/9/17, 5:54:48 AM] Akshay: Classes cancelled across unis, schools
[2/9/17, 5:54:54 AM] Akshay: Snowstorm lol
[2/9/17, 5:55:54 AM] Akshay: I told my sister I'd treat her in Dubai, if she walked across the road to some shop or somewhere in this weather and could prove itüòú
[2/9/17, 5:56:23 AM] Akshay: Then my mother immediately admonished me for such an idea :")
[2/9/17, 6:17:58 AM] Akshay: The place I have to go to at 11 is about 30 min walk away
[2/9/17, 6:18:13 AM] Akshay: Will cost 9$ uber I think
[2/9/17, 6:18:18 AM] Akshay: What should I do
[2/9/17, 6:18:58 AM] Akshay: Ignore the last three messages... Was intending to write to my parents
[2/9/17, 6:19:03 AM] Akshay: Sorry
[2/9/17, 7:29:54 AM] Rahul: lol I'm going to NYC this tomorrow to meet my dad
[2/9/17, 7:30:36 AM] Rahul: My dad has to walk to worküòè
[2/9/17, 7:31:37 AM] Rahul: He sent me these
[2/9/17, 7:32:39 AM] Rahul: I think the storm ends today though
[2/9/17, 7:39:57 AM] Akshay: Rahul do you have a holiday
[2/9/17, 7:40:02 AM] Rahul: No
[2/9/17, 7:40:09 AM] Akshay: I have a midterm break now-today and tomorrow
[2/9/17, 7:40:10 AM] Rahul: I'm just skipping classes
[2/9/17, 7:40:32 AM] Rahul: I have spring break in march
[2/9/17, 7:41:51 AM] Akshay: I have that too. That's a whole week for me.
[2/9/17, 7:42:01 AM] Rahul: Yah same
[2/9/17, 7:42:11 AM] Rahul: I don't have any break right now
[2/9/17, 7:46:00 AM] Akshay: Ok
[2/9/17, 8:14:58 AM] Sunil: I don't think I have a midterm break as such
[2/9/17, 5:07:47 PM] Suyash: Weather here i getting rlly good, pleasant. Same with TX Akshay, Sunil?
[2/9/17, 6:00:53 PM] Sunil: It's fluctuating Suyash, today was pretty cold
[2/9/17, 7:15:11 PM] Akshay: Today very windy, quite cold
[2/9/17, 7:15:14 PM] Akshay: Yesterday was nice
[2/14/17, 11:27:55 AM] Suyash: http://m.gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/uae-to-build-first-city-on-mars-by-2117-1.1978549
[2/14/17, 11:28:00 AM] Suyash: Lol wtf
[2/14/17, 12:29:14 PM] Akshay: Haha
[2/14/17, 12:30:11 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[2/14/17, 12:33:08 PM] Akshay: Lol uae
[2/14/17, 12:33:29 PM] Akshay: 100 years is a long time in the current age though. They might pull it off
[2/14/17, 12:33:58 PM] Akshay: Then, never know, maybe the hidden agenda is to control oil on mars, to keep the dollars flowing in :")
[2/14/17, 3:57:55 PM] Suyash: Lol yup
[2/14/17, 3:58:26 PM] Suyash: I feel like all the money dumped onto space exploration is a waste
[2/14/17, 3:58:40 PM] Suyash: Until problems on earth are first solved
[2/14/17, 3:58:55 PM] Suyash: Unless going to space is the solution to all said problems
[2/14/17, 4:03:11 PM] Akshay: Definitely
[2/14/17, 4:03:34 PM] Akshay: It might be a solution albeit with more problems and at greater cost and difficulty
[2/14/17, 4:25:48 PM] Suyash: I'm getting screwed by my enrollment appointment
[2/14/17, 4:26:12 PM] Suyash: Physics, good prof has 2 sections will almost 400 seats overall in the morning
[2/14/17, 4:26:22 PM] Suyash: Now 26 left, still have 3 hrs for my time
[2/14/17, 4:40:47 PM] Akshay: What is the enrolment appointment?
[2/14/17, 4:40:52 PM] Akshay: For third quarter?
[2/14/17, 5:17:21 PM] Suyash: Yup
[2/14/17, 5:18:44 PM] Suyash: Ive decided to chuck physics and lab entirely, instead take a GE, Discrete Math (otherwise in 2nd year)
[2/14/17, 5:18:51 PM] Suyash: Not ideal, but what to do
[2/14/17, 5:31:08 PM] Akshay: Ahh that's fine
[2/14/17, 5:31:40 PM] Akshay: Unlike conventional mech/civil engineering, although the physics is a requirement for you, it won't hinder your understanding of CS
[2/14/17, 5:32:02 PM] Suyash: Yeah it's BS pretty much
[2/14/17, 5:32:02 PM] Akshay: Whereas for rahul, Sunil, me without mechanics physics, engineering classes might get impossible
[2/14/17, 5:32:07 PM] Suyash: Yup
[2/14/17, 5:32:19 PM] Suyash: I'm quite annoyed that I have to take physics
[2/14/17, 5:32:18 PM] Akshay: Man physics and CS have barely any connection
[2/14/17, 5:32:25 PM] Suyash: Exactly
[2/16/17, 8:02:04 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/16/17, 8:23:59 AM] Akshay: Lol
[2/16/17, 11:34:09 AM] Suyash: :"")
[2/16/17, 11:34:26 AM] Suyash: Do you think India should spend so much on all this
[2/16/17, 12:18:28 PM] Akshay: In some ways though it feels really good when you hear of India doing this kind of stuff
[2/16/17, 12:19:02 PM] Akshay: But also as you point out, needs to be balanced with improving the lives of people here on earth, especially with the problems people face in India
[2/16/17, 12:36:54 PM] Suyash: Definitely feels great
[2/17/17, 4:11:05 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/17/17, 4:11:24 AM] Akshay: This one seemed too easyü§î

[2/17/17, 1:06:47 PM] Suyash: Lol opposite here
[2/17/17, 1:06:57 PM] Suyash: Yesterday 22 in the day, nice sun
[2/17/17, 1:07:04 PM] Suyash: Today it's pouring, very windy
[2/18/17, 3:40:22 AM] Udit: It was snowing here last week
[2/18/17, 3:40:25 AM] Udit: :'')
[2/20/17, 4:18:08 AM] Udit: Hey
[2/20/17, 4:18:17 AM] Udit: Happy Bday suyash!!
[2/20/17, 4:21:10 AM] Sunil: Happy birthday Suyash üéÇ
[2/20/17, 5:01:41 AM] Akshay: Happy birthday suyash
[2/20/17, 10:14:55 AM] Suyash: Thank you lads!
[2/20/17, 10:34:08 AM] Rahul: Happy birthday dude
[2/20/17, 12:10:31 PM] Suyash: Thanks man
[2/24/17, 12:30:33 PM] ‚ÄéUdit changed their phone number to a new number. Tap to message or add the new number.
[2/25/17, 1:42:21 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/25/17, 1:43:22 PM] Rahul: I did this today
[2/25/17, 1:43:35 PM] Rahul: I think I may have got 2 questions correct
[2/25/17, 1:44:11 PM] Rahul: It was a math competition open to any freshman taking a math course
[2/25/17, 1:44:26 PM] Rahul: But there were only like 17 people there
[2/25/17, 1:44:31 PM] Suyash: Damn this is next level stuff
[2/25/17, 1:44:46 PM] Rahul: The second one kinda easy

[3/21/17, 5:57:14 PM] Udit: Wow
[3/21/17, 5:59:36 PM] Akshay: Nah us implies you too... And suyash did IB so...
[3/23/17, 8:42:56 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/23/17, 8:42:59 PM] Akshay: üòÇ
[3/23/17, 8:43:41 PM] Udit: So true
[3/23/17, 8:43:50 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[3/24/17, 3:06:16 PM] Rahul: Anyone wants storage over summer
[3/24/17, 3:06:30 PM] Rahul: I'm using the site dorm room movers.com
[3/24/17, 3:06:57 PM] Rahul: Use the coupon code 3b81c3c0
[3/24/17, 3:07:12 PM] Suyash: How much is it?
[3/24/17, 3:07:17 PM] Udit: It's not here in UK right?
[3/24/17, 3:17:43 PM] Rahul: Seems to be in the range of 200 bucks for the entire summer
[3/24/17, 3:18:04 PM] Rahul: They will quote me tho depending on how much stuff I store exactly
[3/24/17, 3:28:54 PM] Rahul: 44 per box entire summer
[3/24/17, 3:29:20 PM] Rahul: So I should have a bill between 132 and 176
[3/24/17, 3:48:47 PM] Suyash: Idk if that's good or bad haha
[3/24/17, 3:48:55 PM] Suyash: Probably more expensive in LA
[3/24/17, 3:56:38 PM] Rahul: Yup
[3/24/17, 3:56:49 PM] Rahul: California just price everything times 2
[3/29/17, 4:05:42 PM] Rahul: Wats up my dudes
[3/29/17, 4:06:02 PM] Rahul: After this weekend, 26 days for getting back to Dubai
[3/29/17, 4:06:21 PM] Rahul: I have 3 months and 18 days in India and Dubai total
[3/29/17, 4:09:01 PM] Sunil: I think I'm traveling to Dubai around 10th May
[3/29/17, 4:09:08 PM] Sunil: So still some time to go
[3/29/17, 4:09:24 PM] Sunil: But this semester is going by so fast
[3/29/17, 4:09:41 PM] Sunil: Probably bc there's so much work to do on a daily basis
[3/29/17, 4:10:21 PM] Udit: I am going tmr!!!!!
[3/29/17, 4:11:08 PM] Sunil: Oh wow that's great man
[3/29/17, 4:11:21 PM] Udit: Ik I can't wait
[3/29/17, 4:11:41 PM] Sunil: So Udit is your semester over
[3/29/17, 4:11:41 PM] Udit: And I am in library now trying to finish my stuff
[3/29/17, 4:11:47 PM] Udit: So many submissions
[3/29/17, 4:11:48 PM] Udit: No
[3/29/17, 4:12:00 PM] Udit: I hv a month after this
[3/29/17, 4:12:05 PM] Sunil: How long is your summer break
[3/29/17, 4:12:10 PM] Udit: And then finals
[3/29/17, 4:12:14 PM] Sunil: Oh
[3/29/17, 4:12:19 PM] Udit: I think 3 months
[3/29/17, 4:15:19 PM] Rahul: Lucky Udit
[3/29/17, 4:16:12 PM] Rahul: I'm going 30th April but not counting the last 2 days because I'll basically be free finals end 28th
[3/29/17, 4:19:38 PM] Akshay: Rahul man
[3/29/17, 4:19:53 PM] Akshay: That's way less than mine, although we started class on the same date
[3/29/17, 4:20:04 PM] Akshay: I think the difference is that rice has two finals weeks
[3/29/17, 4:20:15 PM] Akshay: So I'll be flying back 5th May
[3/29/17, 4:20:39 PM] Akshay: I have to get back 20 August to uni
[3/29/17, 4:20:51 PM] Akshay: So I have 3 months, 15 days~
[3/29/17, 4:21:05 PM] Akshay: Dubai, india, then Dubai again
[3/29/17, 4:21:19 PM] Akshay: Suyash is in Dubai rn, none of us can beat that !
[3/29/17, 4:28:21 PM] Rahul: I'll be back august 18
[3/29/17, 4:28:34 PM] Rahul: So 3 months, 18 days
[3/29/17, 4:28:54 PM] Rahul: Suyash too lucky
[3/29/17, 4:29:24 PM] Rahul: OS same 2 finals weeks
[3/29/17, 4:29:40 PM] Rahul: They go till 5th May but I just got lucky
[3/29/17, 4:29:51 PM] Rahul: My exams start 27th, end 28th
[3/29/17, 4:31:00 PM] Sunil: Lucky you guys
[3/29/17, 4:31:13 PM] Sunil: My exams start on 5th
[3/29/17, 4:32:53 PM] Akshay: Ahh damn
[3/29/17, 4:33:11 PM] Akshay: But did you buy tickets only after knowing the dates of your finals?
[3/29/17, 4:33:28 PM] Akshay: My parents bought tickets earlier, hence had to assume the last date
[3/29/17, 4:33:44 PM] Akshay: Haha Sunil... We started earlier than you though
[3/29/17, 4:34:01 PM] Akshay: Your schedule matches my sister's schedule a bit more closely
[3/29/17, 4:34:18 PM] Akshay: But suyash imo, in this part of the year is more unlucky
[3/29/17, 4:34:31 PM] Sunil: Unlucky?
[3/29/17, 4:34:39 PM] Akshay: Because after this one week in Dubai, he has 2.5 more months of uni
[3/29/17, 4:34:46 PM] Akshay: Till end of june
[3/29/17, 4:34:51 PM] Sunil: Oh dang, that sucks
[3/29/17, 4:34:58 PM] Akshay: And then in the second part of the year, he is better off
[3/29/17, 4:35:49 PM] Akshay: Because his is only beginning from end of September. And finishes same time/slightly earlier than me, rahul , by first week of December
[3/29/17, 4:47:36 PM] Rahul: Yup
[3/29/17, 4:48:40 PM] Rahul: I booked after knowing dates because here the dates for each course final exam are set at beginning of semester
[3/29/17, 4:49:00 PM] Rahul: Like historically many have been on same date
[3/29/17, 4:49:32 PM] Rahul: My physics course exam has been on 28th April for past 4 years
[3/29/17, 4:56:23 PM] Akshay: Ahh that way
[3/29/17, 4:56:27 PM] Akshay: That's cool
[3/29/17, 4:56:47 PM] Akshay: I doubt it's fixed at my uni, the final dates haven't been revealed yet for this semester
[3/29/17, 4:56:50 PM] Akshay: Probably next week
[3/29/17, 4:59:37 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/29/17, 5:00:16 PM] Akshay: üëçüèæ
[3/30/17, 2:46:26 PM] Akshay: Did you guys just watch Federer berdych
[3/30/17, 2:46:29 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[3/30/17, 2:46:34 PM] Akshay: Berdych
[3/30/17, 2:46:40 PM] Akshay: So good, so close, yet so far
[3/30/17, 2:46:54 PM] Akshay: In one minute, he went from having match point, to losing
[3/30/17, 2:55:55 PM] Akshay: I definitely hate Federer now.üòÅ
[3/30/17, 3:31:49 PM] Rahul: Maaaan
[3/30/17, 3:31:58 PM] Rahul: I missed the match doing engineering homework
[3/30/17, 3:39:36 PM] Akshay: I was watching a bit while studying for math midterm
[3/30/17, 3:39:46 PM] Akshay: Hw is too pissing off most times
[3/30/17, 4:22:04 PM] Rahul: Yup
[3/30/17, 4:22:16 PM] Rahul: The most annoying things are the GEs
[3/30/17, 4:22:36 PM] Rahul: It's like I'm done with all the stuff that's important to me and my life....
[3/30/17, 4:22:58 PM] Rahul: And then there's a 5 page draft of the final paper for ENGLISH due tomorrow
[3/30/17, 4:23:24 PM] Rahul: Like who gives a flying fuck
[3/30/17, 4:23:45 PM] Rahul: But u still have to do it or your GPA tanks
[3/30/17, 7:16:32 PM] Akshay: Ironically, those end up being even harder than the core STEM major courses
[3/30/17, 7:16:46 PM] Akshay: Like you will struggle through physics or engineering and somehow manage A
[3/30/17, 7:17:01 PM] Akshay: And then in some shitty distribution class, get a B+
[3/30/17, 7:31:03 PM] Rahul: Exactly
[3/31/17, 12:18:35 AM] Suyash: GPA rekt this time, already gotten Bs in Math and Physics
[3/31/17, 2:50:54 AM] Rahul: Dam
[3/31/17, 7:54:46 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/31/17, 7:55:31 AM] Suyash: Lolol
[3/31/17, 7:56:29 AM] Rahul: Just got this during my physics class was sitting in front row and burst out laughing
[3/31/17, 8:58:18 AM] Akshay: Typical
[3/31/17, 11:54:00 AM] Rahul: Thanks
[3/31/17, 11:54:17 AM] Rahul: I haven't changed too much that way
[3/31/17, 12:13:14 PM] Akshay: Yup, stay the same :")
[3/31/17, 12:52:09 PM] Rahul: Anything wrong with that?
[3/31/17, 1:27:44 PM] Akshay: No mate, I'm saying it is good!
[3/31/17, 1:28:37 PM] Akshay: But anyway, out of all in this group, rahul has changed the most- he actually studies for exams now :")
[3/31/17, 1:30:35 PM] Akshay: Well the only change I saw in Udit in December was the extreme weight loss due to bad/expensive food in UK!
[3/31/17, 1:31:40 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/31/17, 1:31:43 PM] Akshay: Even with exams et al
[3/31/17, 1:31:52 PM] Akshay: Tomorrow is some huge event, called beer bike
[3/31/17, 1:31:54 PM] Akshay: It's a huge deal
[3/31/17, 1:32:23 PM] Akshay: It's supposed to be a biking race between residential colleges, but there's also an alcoholism part involved
[3/31/17, 1:32:40 PM] Akshay: And generally a week of excessive celebration and happiness for some reason
[3/31/17, 1:36:42 PM] Rahul: Woah is that outside ur dorm
[3/31/17, 1:36:50 PM] Rahul: Looks nice
[3/31/17, 1:37:33 PM] Akshay: It's just outside my college building yes
[3/31/17, 1:37:41 PM] Rahul: Ahh
[3/31/17, 1:37:49 PM] Rahul: Next year going to be lit
[3/31/17, 1:37:50 PM] Akshay: It looks nice but right now is in an alcoholic mess
[3/31/17, 1:37:59 PM] Rahul: Ahh I see
[3/31/17, 1:38:05 PM] Rahul: Puke everywhere?
[3/31/17, 1:38:32 PM] Akshay: Not yet
[3/31/17, 1:38:52 PM] Rahul: *"Next year going to lit" was not meant for this chat
[3/31/17, 1:39:19 PM] Akshay: There's also this generic western tendency to indulge in any celebration or fun by taking off clothes
[3/31/17, 1:39:39 PM] Akshay: It is good weather but we aren't exactly at some beach lolol
[3/31/17, 1:40:30 PM] Rahul: Lol
[3/31/17, 1:40:45 PM] Rahul: Do u see white people jogging with only boxers on?
[3/31/17, 1:40:57 PM] Rahul: That's common when it's sunny here
[3/31/17, 1:46:03 PM] Akshay: Yup common
[3/31/17, 7:21:51 PM] Akshay: Absolute peach of a match
[3/31/17, 7:21:54 PM] Akshay: Fed vs kyrgios
[3/31/17, 7:21:58 PM] Akshay: Fed on mp
[3/31/17, 7:22:04 PM] Akshay: Lucky bug wins again
[3/31/17, 7:22:20 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[3/31/17, 7:28:09 PM] Rahul: Hahahahhaha
[3/31/17, 7:28:19 PM] Rahul: Fed pressure king
[3/31/17, 7:28:35 PM] Rahul: Undeniably GOAT
[3/31/17, 7:28:53 PM] Rahul: For his ability to hold his piss and win under any situation
[3/31/17, 7:31:13 PM] Akshay: Man
[3/31/17, 7:31:19 PM] Akshay: He's also incredibly lucky
[3/31/17, 7:31:24 PM] Akshay: Come on you have to admit it
[3/31/17, 7:31:30 PM] Akshay: But boy
[3/31/17, 7:31:48 PM] Akshay: I told my friend here during Indian wells when kyrgios quite before playing fed
[3/31/17, 7:32:36 PM] Akshay: That fed at the moment can only be beaten by kyrgios, because he is the only player who plays as aggressive as Fed with the same amount of errors (quite few)
[3/31/17, 7:32:43 PM] Akshay: Not Nadal, Murray etc
[3/31/17, 7:36:51 PM] Rahul: That is true
[3/31/17, 7:37:13 PM] Rahul: I shall also admit fed is incredibly lucky
[3/31/17, 7:38:21 PM] Rahul: I also think zverev is capable of it but for some reason outfits out-aggresifies zverev
[3/31/17, 7:38:57 PM] Rahul: *kyrgios out-aggresifies
[3/31/17, 7:40:07 PM] Akshay: Yeah haha true
[3/31/17, 7:40:19 PM] Akshay: Zverev beat Federer in Perth before Australian open
[3/31/17, 7:40:40 PM] Akshay: But Federer will probably annihilate Nadal again in the final
[3/31/17, 7:40:53 PM] Rahul: We were watching that in Dubai rightüëÜüèΩ
[3/31/17, 7:41:18 PM] Akshay: I firmly support Nadal. He needs to pull one back for the hardworking, struggling, less talented souls of this world.
[3/31/17, 7:41:27 PM] Akshay: Yes good memory
[3/31/17, 7:41:40 PM] Rahul: Not that Nadal is less talented
[3/31/17, 7:41:42 PM] Akshay: I remember that day we were complaining about 4 months of uni shit
[3/31/17, 7:41:52 PM] Akshay: Now, 4 weeks left only
[3/31/17, 7:41:53 PM] Rahul: Federer is just supremely talented
[3/31/17, 7:41:55 PM] Akshay: For me 5
[3/31/17, 7:41:56 PM] Rahul: Yup
[3/31/17, 7:41:59 PM] Rahul: Can't wait
[3/31/17, 7:42:06 PM] Akshay: Nadal is less talented than Fed though
[3/31/17, 7:42:14 PM] Akshay: He has to struggle
[3/31/17, 7:42:14 PM] Rahul: First thing back watch baahubali 2
[3/31/17, 7:42:18 PM] Rahul: Yes
[3/31/17, 7:42:30 PM] Akshay: Lol baahubali, I don't get the rage about that
[3/31/17, 7:42:50 PM] Rahul: I find those black tribal dudes entertaining
[3/31/17, 7:42:58 PM] Rahul: Imitating how they speak
[3/31/17, 7:43:12 PM] Rahul: Tongue clicking
[3/31/17, 7:44:08 PM] Rahul: And why did katappa kill baahubali is still the one question I can't solve
[3/31/17, 7:44:48 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[3/31/17, 7:44:52 PM] Akshay: Especially Murray
[3/31/17, 7:44:57 PM] Akshay: My all time favourite
[3/31/17, 8:09:09 PM] Rahul: At this rate looks like they will lose their rankings soon
[3/31/17, 8:23:48 PM] Akshay: Yeah
[3/31/17, 8:24:09 PM] Akshay: But the best thing that ever happened in 2016, imo, was Murray getting to number 1.
[3/31/17, 8:24:41 PM] Akshay: Truly inspirational. A legendary achievement from someone who seemed to be a permanently excellent loser.
[3/31/17, 8:26:00 PM] Akshay: I don't know why, I seem to appreciate bs like that more than the actual shot-making ability. Talent is obviously there too
[3/31/17, 8:26:07 PM] Akshay: For Murray etc I mean
[4/1/17, 10:52:23 AM] Rahul: Do you guys want to go the French open
[4/1/17, 10:52:36 AM] Rahul: Just us, no parents
[4/1/17, 10:55:27 AM] Suyash: Done.
[4/1/17, 11:03:07 AM] Akshay: Lol that's a question requiring a lot of thought
[4/1/17, 11:25:05 AM] Rahul: Yes Suyash that's the spirit
[4/1/17, 11:25:15 AM] Rahul: Dude Akshay come on
[4/1/17, 11:25:34 AM] Rahul: I hope my dad hasn't booked different tickets tho let me check now only
[4/1/17, 11:34:42 AM] Rahul: Don't think he had just be sleeping it's 10:30 in Dubai
[4/1/17, 11:36:49 AM] Rahul: *he might be sleeping so he no reply, *dont think he has booked diff tickets
[4/1/17, 5:24:56 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/1/17, 5:25:12 PM] Akshay: These are the memes circulating within Columbia uni Facebook groups
[4/1/17, 5:25:23 PM] Akshay: Received by me courtesy my sister
[4/1/17, 5:36:49 PM] Rahul: Woah dude
[4/1/17, 5:37:13 PM] Rahul: Uni spirit is too much in US
[4/1/17, 5:37:41 PM] Rahul: It's like ppl wud go to war for their uni
[4/1/17, 5:38:30 PM] Akshay: Yup lol
[4/1/17, 7:53:14 PM] Akshay: The monthly battle has been won
[4/1/17, 7:53:29 PM] Rahul: Eh?
[4/1/17, 7:53:38 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/1/17, 7:53:51 PM] Rahul: Lol
[4/1/17, 7:53:57 PM] Akshay: Stupid task. Takes easily 20 minutes
[4/1/17, 7:55:24 PM] Rahul: Nice bed sheet tho
[4/1/17, 7:55:38 PM] Akshay: Thanks man
[4/1/17, 7:55:55 PM] Rahul: My dad says he'll find out about visa and let me know
[4/1/17, 7:55:55 PM] Akshay: I have two colours-dark blue and this checked one
[4/1/17, 7:56:51 PM] Rahul: I don't like plain colors
[4/1/17, 7:57:09 PM] Rahul: Unless it's white/ close to white
[4/1/17, 7:57:30 PM] Akshay: Ah
[4/1/17, 7:57:56 PM] Akshay: 6 years ago today, best cricket event in memory
[4/1/17, 7:58:01 PM] Akshay: India winning WC
[4/1/17, 7:58:21 PM] Rahul: Dam
[4/1/17, 7:58:28 PM] Rahul: 6 years it has been
[4/1/17, 8:02:06 PM] Akshay: Yup
[4/1/17, 8:02:23 PM] Akshay: The next day was my first day at GMA coming back
[4/1/17, 11:14:30 PM] Suyash: The next day was also RV Tata returning to school teaching :")
[4/2/17, 11:38:05 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/2/17, 5:50:00 AM] Akshay: Lol
[4/2/17, 5:51:46 AM] Rahul: I will report you to the HiGHer authOriTies
[4/2/17, 5:52:34 AM] Akshay: Who by the way, are the only people allowed to write with green ink pens
[4/2/17, 6:29:26 AM] Rahul: Lol
[4/2/17, 7:56:53 AM] Udit: Rv Tata?
[4/2/17, 8:01:39 AM] Akshay: Alas, udit, that legend was before your time at gma
[4/2/17, 8:01:56 AM] Akshay: He left just before you joined GMA
[4/2/17, 8:02:03 AM] Akshay: Thus one ledge replaced another
[4/2/17, 9:46:17 AM] Udit: Oh alright
[4/2/17, 11:47:47 AM] Rahul: Yeeeessss buoooys
[4/2/17, 11:47:53 AM] Akshay: Fuck
[4/2/17, 11:48:09 AM] Akshay: The guy is lucky and absolutely brilliant
[4/2/17, 11:48:17 AM] Akshay: He is so brilliant he doesn't need luck
[4/2/17, 11:48:28 AM] Akshay: Yet God in all his partiality, gives him more
[4/2/17, 11:48:42 AM] Akshay: I still like Nadal more. Let him lose, but he is a human
[4/2/17, 11:48:47 AM] Akshay: Federer is from the clouds
[4/2/17, 11:48:49 AM] Akshay: Ffs
[4/2/17, 11:49:29 AM] Rahul: I want federe to win French open now
[4/2/17, 11:49:32 AM] Akshay: I'm waiting for Federer to retire
[4/2/17, 11:49:39 AM] Akshay: And then, humans shall win again
[4/2/17, 11:49:40 AM] Rahul: Beating Nadal in the final again
[4/2/17, 11:50:04 AM] Akshay: For fuck's sake
[4/2/17, 11:50:18 AM] Akshay: If NADAL cannot beat Federer, what hope is there for the rest of humanity
[4/2/17, 11:51:08 AM] Rahul: Nadal - fed is still heavily in Nadal favorite tho
[4/2/17, 11:51:21 AM] Rahul: In historical terms i.e. Head to head
[4/2/17, 11:51:27 AM] Akshay: Man
[4/2/17, 11:51:44 AM] Akshay: Now in 2017 itself they'll play like 10 times, Federer will win all of them
[4/2/17, 11:51:58 AM] Rahul: Lol that might be true
[4/2/17, 11:52:13 AM] Akshay: It was consolation to all people who had a favourite who was not Federer-that Federer owned tennis but Nadal owned Federer
[4/2/17, 11:52:21 AM] Akshay: That small solace has vanished
[4/2/17, 11:52:35 AM] Akshay: Now the only hope is to get behind Muzza
[4/2/17, 11:52:44 AM] Akshay: Maybe as number 1 he will have something extra
[4/2/17, 11:52:52 AM] Akshay: Allez Murray!
[4/2/17, 11:53:10 AM] Akshay: Rahul, do you remember hafid shouting Allez
[4/2/17, 11:53:14 AM] Akshay: In french
[4/2/17, 11:53:19 AM] Rahul: Yup
[4/2/17, 11:53:27 AM] Rahul: So funny
[4/2/17, 11:53:36 AM] Rahul: Have you heard from him again
[4/2/17, 11:53:41 AM] Akshay: Nope.
[4/2/17, 11:53:47 AM] Rahul: Alas
[4/2/17, 11:53:51 AM] Akshay: Nadal man
[4/2/17, 11:53:53 AM] Akshay: Nadal
[4/2/17, 11:53:54 AM] Rahul: He had vanished forever
[4/2/17, 11:53:58 AM] Rahul: *has
[4/2/17, 11:53:58 AM] Akshay: I'm not even talking of Murray
[4/2/17, 11:54:02 AM] Akshay: But Nadal
[4/2/17, 11:54:10 AM] Akshay: The greatest Federer beater in history
[4/2/17, 11:54:20 AM] Akshay: How can he not win against Federer
[4/2/17, 11:54:30 AM] Akshay: My faith in humanity has vanished
[4/2/17, 11:54:55 AM] Akshay: Looking at some of Federer's backhands today, you could basically see some shades of God
[4/2/17, 11:54:58 AM] Akshay: Think of it
[4/2/17, 11:56:19 AM] Rahul: This is true
[4/2/17, 11:56:30 AM] Akshay: Nadal is tad emo
[4/2/17, 11:56:35 AM] Rahul: Lol
[4/2/17, 11:57:28 AM] Akshay: Damn
[4/2/17, 11:57:36 AM] Akshay: That Spanish sounds pretty insane
[4/2/17, 11:57:38 AM] Akshay: So fat
[4/2/17, 11:57:41 AM] Akshay: Fast*
[4/2/17, 11:57:54 AM] Rahul: Are you just watching now?
[4/2/17, 11:58:04 AM] Akshay: Yup
[4/2/17, 11:58:06 AM] Rahul: I'm already seeing fed on stage!
[4/2/17, 11:58:14 AM] Akshay: Yup
[4/2/17, 11:58:28 AM] Akshay: Little boy to big man lolol
[4/2/17, 11:58:52 AM] Akshay: Nadal looks like he has tears
[4/2/17, 11:58:56 AM] Akshay: But also sweat so idk
[4/2/17, 11:59:20 AM] Rahul: He was sweating so much tho
[4/2/17, 11:59:20 AM] Akshay: I predicted Federer would say the dream continues lolol
[4/2/17, 11:59:53 AM] Rahul: Seems strange cos you wud think the guy from Spain wud sweat less under hot conditions than the Swiss
[4/2/17, 12:00:09 PM] Akshay: Nadal always sweat more
[4/2/17, 12:00:15 PM] Akshay: It's also genetic
[4/2/17, 12:00:31 PM] Akshay: Sweating more is actually a sign of being more accustomed to the heat
[4/2/17, 12:00:46 PM] Akshay: Nadal's body is probably mildly cooler than fed right now
[4/2/17, 12:00:52 PM] Akshay: Because of that excessive sweating
[4/2/17, 12:01:09 PM] Rahul: Ahh I see
[4/2/17, 12:01:32 PM] Akshay: Where on earth is Murray
[4/2/17, 12:01:55 PM] Akshay: He is in Dubai, but the guy must come to save the world from the supernatural invasion of Roger Fed
[4/2/17, 12:02:44 PM] Akshay: Federer is number 4 in rankings now
[4/2/17, 12:02:53 PM] Akshay: Just insane
[4/2/17, 12:03:03 PM] Rahul: Nadal?
[4/2/17, 12:03:09 PM] Akshay: Nadal probably 6
[4/2/17, 12:03:18 PM] Rahul: Ok
[4/2/17, 12:03:23 PM] Rahul: Who third?
[4/2/17, 12:03:28 PM] Rahul: Wawtinka?
[4/2/17, 12:03:43 PM] Akshay: Yup
[4/2/17, 12:03:48 PM] Akshay: Murray maintains his spot
[4/2/17, 12:03:56 PM] Akshay: Him and Djokovic are still well ahead of waw
[4/2/17, 12:04:02 PM] Akshay: Man Murray
[4/2/17, 12:04:11 PM] Rahul: But how
[4/2/17, 12:04:13 PM] Akshay: The guy better be working his bottoms off
[4/2/17, 12:04:26 PM] Rahul: Don't they start losing points if they don't win for long
[4/2/17, 12:04:29 PM] Akshay: Otherwise, we'll soon be back to 2006
[4/2/17, 12:04:30 PM] Akshay: Yes
[4/2/17, 12:04:36 PM] Akshay: But they were SO far ahead
[4/2/17, 12:04:58 PM] Akshay: And Murray actually didn't lose to many points this month because he did so badly last year also
[4/2/17, 12:05:07 PM] Akshay: But Djokovic lost an insane number of points
[4/2/17, 12:05:15 PM] Rahul: Ahh ok
[4/2/17, 12:05:27 PM] Akshay: Where is Djokovic tho
[4/2/17, 12:05:35 PM] Akshay: Definitely doesn't seem to be on earth
[4/2/17, 12:05:46 PM] Akshay: He seems lackadaisical rn
[4/2/17, 12:05:51 PM] Rahul: Back in Serbia
[4/2/17, 12:05:58 PM] Akshay: Yeah
[4/2/17, 12:06:20 PM] Akshay: Bye
[4/2/17, 12:06:25 PM] Akshay: Got to be back at work
[4/2/17, 12:06:29 PM] Rahul: Bye
[4/2/17, 2:41:21 PM] Akshay: Woah are you on the flight back

[4/2/17, 2:41:46 PM] Suyash: Yes only 5 hrs left
[4/2/17, 2:42:05 PM] Suyash: Woke up to see the match playing live, pretty epic
[4/2/17, 2:43:45 PM] Akshay: Good. Unfortunate outcome
[4/2/17, 2:44:08 PM] Akshay: Murray and Nadal performing well will inspire me to perform well at this last part of the semester
[4/2/17, 2:44:15 PM] Akshay: Else, I shall flunk my exams
[4/2/17, 2:44:19 PM] Akshay: I'm serious lol
[4/2/17, 2:44:22 PM] Suyash: Lol
[4/2/17, 3:45:56 PM] Rahul: Bro are u carrying ur laptop in hand baggage?
[4/2/17, 3:46:39 PM] Rahul: I'm pretty worried about putting my laptop in checked baggage
[4/2/17, 3:46:45 PM] Rahul: Might be damaged
[4/2/17, 8:06:21 PM] Suyash: Yes I have had to pack it
[4/2/17, 8:06:34 PM] Suyash: Put it in between a blanket, in a cover etc
[4/2/17, 8:16:46 PM] Suyash: They're also stopping for big headphones and stuff
[4/2/17, 8:37:23 PM] Akshay: Damn
[4/2/17, 8:49:54 PM] Rahul: Shit
[4/2/17, 8:50:33 PM] Rahul: Fuckers
[4/2/17, 8:51:01 PM] Rahul: This is stupid
[4/2/17, 9:00:15 PM] Akshay: Yup
[4/2/17, 9:00:46 PM] Rahul: Was this also the case when going to Dubai
[4/2/17, 9:39:29 PM] Suyash: Nope, outbound you can take everything
[4/3/17, 5:09:32 AM] Rahul: Cool so no need to worry right now
[4/3/17, 9:52:25 PM] Suyash: Yup

[4/9/17, 9:40:08 AM] Rahul: lol I've been counting down the days, hours, minutes for the past 3 weeks
[4/9/17, 9:42:12 AM] Sunil: Lol

[4/9/17, 9:56:08 AM] Akshay: Ahh
[4/9/17, 9:56:14 AM] Akshay: Your schedule follows my sister's
[4/9/17, 9:56:27 AM] Akshay: Started one week after me and rahul, finishing also a week later
[4/9/17, 9:56:43 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[4/9/17, 9:57:00 AM] Sunil: How's everything going so far
[4/9/17, 10:03:19 AM] Akshay: It's going alright
[4/9/17, 10:03:24 AM] Akshay: Now is the last part of the semester
[4/9/17, 10:03:35 AM] Akshay: In some subjects basically only the last big assignment left
[4/9/17, 10:03:48 AM] Akshay: Need to close it out well and get As
[4/9/17, 10:06:57 AM] Rahul: Yup
[4/9/17, 10:07:11 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[4/9/17, 10:07:12 AM] Rahul: Finals and stuff
[4/9/17, 10:19:04 AM] Akshay: This semester is not short
[4/9/17, 10:19:10 AM] Akshay: But it feels like it went quickly
[4/9/17, 10:19:18 AM] Akshay: It's only one week less than fall term
[4/9/17, 10:52:07 AM] Rahul: Yes
[4/9/17, 10:52:23 AM] Rahul: It has been rough towards the end tho
[4/9/17, 11:58:53 AM] Akshay: Definitely
[4/14/17, 12:32:21 PM] Rahul: Hahahahhaha just came back from engineering exam
[4/14/17, 12:32:31 PM] Rahul: Probably got a 55 percent
[4/14/17, 12:32:47 PM] Rahul: It was so hard that it was funny
[4/14/17, 12:48:23 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/14/17, 1:39:58 PM] Akshay: Damn
[4/14/17, 1:41:12 PM] Sunil: Oh dang
[4/15/17, 5:48:46 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/15/17, 5:49:39 AM] Udit: Gr8!!
[4/15/17, 5:50:39 AM] Rahul: Yup
[4/15/17, 5:50:56 AM] Sunil: That's good üëç
[4/15/17, 5:51:14 AM] Rahul: We should also make it a point to fly back Emirates instead of delta or American
[4/15/17, 5:52:12 AM] Akshay: Yup Emirates is good
[4/15/17, 5:52:20 AM] Akshay: Sometimes the flight is too expensive though
[4/15/17, 5:52:29 AM] Akshay: Compared to some other airlines
[4/15/17, 5:52:49 AM] Rahul: It's not about the price tho dude
[4/15/17, 5:52:55 AM] Rahul: UAE spirit
[4/15/17, 5:53:06 AM] Rahul: We lived there for 17 years
[4/15/17, 5:53:13 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[4/15/17, 5:53:19 AM] Akshay: UAE spirit lol
[4/15/17, 5:53:25 AM] Akshay: What is that
[4/15/17, 5:53:42 AM] Rahul: Least we can do is support it when some bitches trying to damage it
[4/15/17, 5:54:15 AM] Akshay: Emirates is just an airline
[4/15/17, 5:54:23 AM] Akshay: But who's damaging what dude
[4/15/17, 5:54:39 AM] Rahul: There's obviously no security reason behind this applicable JUST to US and UK
[4/15/17, 5:55:11 AM] Rahul: I think they did this just to damage Middle eastern airlines business
[4/15/17, 5:55:32 AM] Rahul: So pppl wud fly delta/American/British airlines
[4/15/17, 5:55:37 AM] Rahul: While going there
[4/15/17, 5:56:15 AM] Rahul: Which is a total dick move
[4/15/17, 5:56:47 AM] Akshay: But delta or American still wouldn't allow you to take your electronics with you on board, which means they are also relying on a price differential to increase the demand for delta et al
[4/15/17, 5:57:07 AM] Rahul: ?
[4/15/17, 5:57:28 AM] Rahul: No delta would allow you
[4/15/17, 5:57:34 AM] Rahul: That's the thing
[4/15/17, 5:57:59 AM] Rahul: They only banned specific AIRLINES from specific countries
[4/15/17, 5:58:01 AM] Akshay: Ok so I don't know the ruleüòÇ
[4/15/17, 5:58:24 AM] Rahul: ...and they gave some lame security reason
[4/15/17, 6:00:45 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[4/15/17, 6:03:42 AM] Akshay: Cool
[4/15/17, 6:03:48 AM] Akshay: I was just reading about it
[4/15/17, 6:04:02 AM] Akshay: Yeah it's pretty damaging to these airlines/countries
[4/15/17, 6:06:38 AM] Akshay: Tbh though, these are legitimate sources of threat-but I agree the rule should apply to ALL airlines from these airports (if at all such a rule should exist)
[4/15/17, 3:23:05 PM] Rahul: Man I'm feeling pretty sad about the last week
[4/15/17, 3:23:45 PM] Rahul: On wednesday, I caught my roommate trying to steal my math project from my bag while I was sleeping
[4/15/17, 3:26:27 PM] Sunil: Shit what did you do then
[4/15/17, 3:29:56 PM] Akshay: Woah insane
[4/15/17, 3:31:25 PM] Rahul: Just told him that he wasn't getting it since he managed to ask so politely
[4/15/17, 3:32:00 PM] Rahul: Kept my bag next to my head and went to sleep
[4/15/17, 3:32:36 PM] Akshay: Is he in same math class
[4/15/17, 3:32:40 PM] Rahul: Yup
[4/15/17, 3:32:46 PM] Rahul: But he's stupid
[4/15/17, 3:33:02 PM] Rahul: For all I know he's getting a D right now
[4/15/17, 3:39:40 PM] Akshay: Ahh ok
[4/15/17, 3:43:16 PM] Akshay: Protect your hard work buddy
[4/15/17, 4:07:00 PM] Suyash: Damn
[4/16/17, 6:02:40 PM] Rahul: Have you guys seen what happened in Cleveland
[4/16/17, 6:02:50 PM] Rahul: Some crazy ass shot 15 ppl dead
[4/16/17, 6:03:09 PM] Rahul: Posting live videos of shootings on Facebook
[4/16/17, 6:03:17 PM] Rahul: He's still loose
[4/16/17, 6:08:32 PM] Akshay: Damn I hadn't seen that
[4/16/17, 6:08:42 PM] Akshay: This country is just truly weird
[4/16/17, 6:11:01 PM] Sunil: That's so crazy and messed up
[4/16/17, 6:11:26 PM] Akshay: All I can think of right now is going home in 3 weeks
[4/16/17, 6:13:45 PM] Rahul: Same
[4/16/17, 6:13:50 PM] Rahul: Fucking stupid man
[4/16/17, 6:15:20 PM] Rahul: Just pulls by some 70 year old man and says say the name of this woman - "bla bla bla", he says it and then he tells the old guy "she's the reason I'm going to do this to you" and shoots him square in the face
[4/16/17, 6:15:33 PM] Rahul: Blew his brains out
[4/16/17, 6:15:38 PM] Rahul: Disgusting
[4/16/17, 6:24:15 PM] Akshay: It's just unbelievably insane
[4/16/17, 6:24:22 PM] Akshay: What's the world coming to
[4/17/17, 1:50:14 AM] Udit: Wow Tc guys

[5/12/17, 9:28:31 AM] Akshay: Woah all packing for one day
[5/12/17, 9:28:44 AM] Akshay: That's insane
[5/12/17, 9:28:52 AM] Akshay: Postpone the flight lol
[5/12/17, 9:29:42 AM] Sunil: I've to also clean my room
[5/12/17, 9:29:51 AM] Sunil: So lots of work to be done
[5/12/17, 9:30:04 AM] Akshay: Yesh
[5/12/17, 9:30:12 AM] Akshay: And put stuff into storage etc
[5/12/17, 9:31:08 AM] Akshay: That's crazy
[5/12/17, 9:45:18 AM] Suyash: Lol how did y'all decide how many boxes to get?
[5/12/17, 9:49:36 AM] Akshay: Funny you ask
[5/12/17, 9:49:50 AM] Akshay: I used some group storage plan that was done at Duncan college
[5/12/17, 9:50:06 AM] Akshay: We had to get our own boxes, the plan was only for the storage space
[5/12/17, 9:50:11 AM] Akshay: I never bought a single box
[5/12/17, 9:50:36 AM] Akshay: Went around my college. Many people had thrown out small/medium size boxes while cleaning
[5/12/17, 9:50:47 AM] Akshay: Stuff like the boxes that Amazon sends stuff in
[5/12/17, 9:51:00 AM] Akshay: I collected like 8 of them and used that lol üòÇ
[5/12/17, 9:51:27 AM] Suyash: Sweet
[5/12/17, 9:52:07 AM] Akshay: But mostly you would buy like 4 large boxes yeah
[5/12/17, 9:52:18 AM] Suyash: I was thinking 2
[5/12/17, 9:52:18 AM] Akshay: And an extra box can be thrown
[5/12/17, 9:52:31 AM] Suyash: Nah here you pay for the box itself
[5/12/17, 9:52:40 AM] Suyash: As in, a box comes with storage
[5/12/17, 9:52:52 AM] Suyash: Like 50 -60 bucks or so for one
[5/12/17, 9:52:52 AM] Akshay: Boxes also can be bought at places like home depot, target etc-if the boxes aren't part of the storage purchase
[5/12/17, 9:53:06 AM] Akshay: Ahh ok that's tough
[5/12/17, 9:53:33 AM] Suyash: What kinda stuff did y'all store?
[5/12/17, 9:53:41 AM] Suyash: Mostly room items yeah?
[5/12/17, 9:54:28 AM] Akshay: Yup
[5/12/17, 9:54:47 AM] Akshay: So in your case it's like the number of boxes you buy is the storage space that you purchase
[5/12/17, 9:56:12 AM] Akshay: For me, I paid a fixed amount for ~30 cubic ft of storage within a common large container
[5/12/17, 9:56:13 AM] Akshay: Sunil RIP
[5/12/17, 9:56:17 AM] Akshay: Your flight shall be postponed lol. One day doing all that work is insanity, neigh on impossible
[5/12/17, 9:56:28 AM] Akshay: Start like this second, you may have a chance
[5/12/17, 9:56:34 AM] Suyash: Woah
[5/12/17, 9:56:57 AM] Suyash: I was planning to pre pone my flight
[5/12/17, 9:58:36 AM] Akshay: Why?
[5/12/17, 9:58:42 AM] Sunil: Lol I'm screwed
[5/12/17, 9:59:21 AM] Suyash: Thought 2 days are too much for packing :")
[5/12/17, 9:59:39 AM] Sunil: I have like half a day
[5/12/17, 10:01:22 AM] Akshay: 2 days is barely enough dude
[5/12/17, 10:01:26 AM] Akshay: It takes ages
[5/12/17, 10:01:33 AM] Akshay: Especially considering exams etc also
[5/12/17, 10:01:42 AM] Akshay: I sort of started mine during examd
[5/12/17, 10:02:58 AM] Suyash: Damn
[5/12/17, 10:03:27 AM] Suyash: Storing pillows, blanket etc will be a pain
[5/12/17, 11:28:19 AM] Akshay: Still needed the whole last 1.5 days!
[5/12/17, 11:28:41 AM] Akshay: Yes
[5/12/17, 11:28:42 AM] Akshay: Everything
[5/12/17, 11:28:56 AM] Akshay: Deciding what to store, what to bring back etc is a pain too
[5/17/17, 3:26:56 AM] Rahul: 6 days left buoys counting down
[5/17/17, 3:53:05 AM] Udit: Wait.... Aren't u in dubai?

[5/21/17, 8:46:51 AM] Sunil: So many good matches to watch today
[5/21/17, 8:47:18 AM] Akshay: Sucks that my favourite Andy Murray is the most invisible top player right now üòñ
[5/21/17, 8:47:51 AM] Sunil: Yeah I don't know what happened to him
[5/21/17, 8:47:54 AM] Akshay: Two weeks ago when Djokovic dropped his coaching team, the media for no proper reason made rumours that agassi will become his new coach.
[5/21/17, 8:48:21 AM] Akshay: And today there's a "report" by Sky Tv that Djokovic WILL make agassi his coach on Wednesday
[5/21/17, 8:48:41 AM] Sunil: Oh wow
[5/21/17, 8:48:45 AM] Akshay: Maybe Djokovic took advice from themüòÇ
[5/21/17, 8:48:53 AM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[5/21/17, 8:52:57 AM] Sunil: The Chelsea game was so satisfying
[5/21/17, 8:53:15 AM] Sunil: Great sendoff for Terry
[5/21/17, 8:53:44 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[5/21/17, 8:53:54 AM] Akshay: Ahh you and your beloved Chelsea
[5/21/17, 8:54:00 AM] Akshay: Did very well this year
[5/21/17, 8:54:13 AM] Akshay: Disappointed with pep guardiola though
[5/21/17, 8:54:19 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[5/21/17, 8:54:27 AM] Akshay: I remember at FCB they all said "world's best coach"
[5/21/17, 8:54:40 AM] Akshay: Tbh, the coach's success depends on the team 99%
[5/21/17, 8:54:47 AM] Sunil: True
[5/21/17, 8:55:27 AM] Rahul: All in Dubai?
[5/21/17, 8:55:31 AM] Akshay: I'd say ranieri winning one bpl with Leicester is bigger than winning ucl, la liga etc with fcb or Madrid, United et al
[5/21/17, 8:55:32 AM] Akshay: No
[5/21/17, 8:55:36 AM] Akshay: Only me, Sunil

[5/21/17, 8:57:40 AM] Sunil: Dubai sports world is also opening next week
[5/21/17, 8:57:54 AM] Sunil: We could probably play sometime there
[5/21/17, 8:58:38 AM] Akshay: Ok
[5/21/17, 10:59:17 AM] Akshay: Rps were comfortable about 20 min ago
[5/21/17, 10:59:30 AM] Akshay: They've been too conservative at batting
[5/21/17, 10:59:52 AM] Akshay: Only 3 wickets down, but they still need runs
[5/21/17, 11:04:00 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[5/21/17, 11:04:16 AM] Sunil: 11 runs needed off last over
[5/21/17, 11:11:22 AM] Akshay: Lol now rps actually aren't favourite
[5/21/17, 11:11:40 AM] Akshay: Confirmed by Djokovic that he will work with agassi at French open
[5/21/17, 11:16:34 AM] Akshay: This is an exemplary answer to the question-
How does one lose an ipl final that could have been easily won?
[5/21/17, 11:19:40 AM] Suyash: Damn

[6/2/17, 11:45:12 AM] Akshay: And Murray gets a bad rep for being too vocal. Atleast he only yells mostly at himself or his coach
[6/2/17, 11:45:36 AM] Akshay: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[6/5/17, 6:07:26 AM] Akshay: Imagine qatari people in UAE have only two weeks to pack up absolutely everything and leave
[6/5/17, 6:07:29 AM] Akshay: Insane
[6/5/17, 8:31:45 AM] Udit: Hows it going guys?!!
[6/5/17, 9:39:14 AM] Rahul: Bakvas bakvas I was watching French open and the beIN channels have been pulled probably because they're Qatari owned
[6/5/17, 9:41:01 AM] Rahul: Yup beIN is owned by Al Jazeera
[6/5/17, 12:00:56 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/5/17, 12:23:12 PM] Udit: Wah Kya baat hai
[6/5/17, 12:23:23 PM] Udit: My last exam day after
[6/5/17, 12:25:03 PM] Akshay: Good luck man
[6/6/17, 12:17:49 AM] Rahul: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[6/6/17, 12:58:44 AM] Suyash: Lol seen this far too many times on FB:")
[6/6/17, 2:01:07 AM] Akshay: Damn but that reaction is crazy
[6/6/17, 2:01:16 AM] Akshay: I think he genuinely got damn scared
[6/6/17, 2:01:32 AM] Akshay: So for this prank, did they just trash a car?
[6/6/17, 2:01:38 AM] Akshay: Lol insane
[6/6/17, 4:14:46 AM] Rahul: Woah that's a different perspective
[6/6/17, 11:27:30 AM] Udit: üòÇüòÇ
[6/7/17, 4:42:54 AM] Akshay: Djokovic out of top 2 for the first time since 2011 march
[6/7/17, 4:43:16 AM] Akshay: Woah. Insane
[6/7/17, 4:49:12 AM] Sunil: Oh damn
[6/7/17, 9:59:26 AM] Suyash: Woah
[6/7/17, 9:59:58 AM] Suyash: Straight sets unbelievable
[6/7/17, 10:00:42 AM] Suyash: It'll be sad if theim reaches the final only to lose to Murray
[6/7/17, 10:04:50 AM] Akshay: Hehehehe first Nadal to get through on Friday :")
[6/7/17, 10:12:30 AM] Rahul: Nadal vs Murray nadal shall win
[6/7/17, 10:12:54 AM] Rahul: Because of the two, I decidedly hate Murray more
[6/7/17, 10:14:19 AM] Akshay: For every "vamos" that Nadal says, Murray shall scream "Come on, LET'S GO!"
[6/7/17, 10:14:30 AM] Akshay: I shall support Murray always.
[6/7/17, 10:14:54 AM] Rahul: Why why why
[6/7/17, 10:15:18 AM] Rahul: That red headed redneck
[6/7/17, 10:19:42 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[6/7/17, 10:20:07 AM] Akshay: Cause he's stubborn. Never gives up. Brilliant. Misunderstood !
[6/7/17, 10:24:47 AM] Akshay: Hopefully Murray vs Nadal final.
[6/7/17, 10:25:02 AM] Akshay: Then, even as a stubborn Murray fan, I'd have to put money on Nadal winning.
[6/7/17, 10:25:24 AM] Akshay: If Murray wins this tournament beating Nadal in the final, then it is the greatest achievement of his career probably
[6/7/17, 10:25:34 AM] Akshay: But wawrinka might be too good in the semi
[6/7/17, 10:25:51 AM] Akshay: What do you'll think
[6/7/17, 10:31:14 AM] Suyash: Ofc I want wawrinka to win the semis
[6/7/17, 10:39:45 AM] Sunil: I'm rooting for wawrinka to win the open
[6/7/17, 10:39:52 AM] Sunil: Let's see what happens
[6/7/17, 11:12:21 AM] Suyash: http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/icse-to-hold-board-exam-for-class-5-and-8-students-from-2018-arathoon/story-DXgHi3mSw7nQHypAhTPcfK.html

[6/7/17, 11:33:40 AM] Akshay: Section C-choose 2 out of 3 or so
[6/7/17, 11:35:29 AM] Akshay: Exam done and dusted thrice/four times a year. Three hours and 32 seconds time of writing. 6 seconds to put in as many knots as possible before the paper is snatched away by the random dude from JSS.
[6/7/17, 11:36:02 AM] Akshay: About 2 Reynolds gel pens done in one eco exam
[6/7/17, 11:36:21 AM] Akshay: 32-35 sheets of horrendously bad and big handwriting
[6/7/17, 11:36:29 AM] Akshay: Ahh that was the life.
[6/7/17, 11:36:35 AM] Akshay: These kids will have it too hard
[6/7/17, 11:42:16 AM] Sunil: Well said
[6/7/17, 11:42:20 AM] Sunil: Very true

[6/8/17, 12:54:24 AM] Akshay: I'll be here from 8-20 Aug. We can hopefully meet up often then if you all are around
[6/8/17, 12:54:54 AM] Akshay: Ofc I'll be on whatsapp most of the time, so the banter shall continue unabated
[6/8/17, 12:55:40 AM] Akshay: And if any of you are in Bangalore, we should try to meet :")
[6/8/17, 7:12:32 AM] Akshay: Bye guys

[6/9/17, 9:14:37 AM] Suyash: Wawrinka epic
[6/9/17, 9:34:11 AM] Akshay: Too good. Credit given where it is due. Deserves the final. I support him now.
[6/9/17, 9:34:54 AM] Akshay: Good tournament for Murray. Magnificent mental reserves. Great fight.
[6/10/17, 3:27:43 PM] Suyash: Insane upset in the women's draw as well
[6/11/17, 11:04:29 PM] Akshay: Yeah. Very interesting Roland garros

[6/18/17, 10:17:01 AM] Akshay: Kashmir = ( > ü§î) Switzerland, from what we saw so far
[6/18/17, 10:17:14 AM] Akshay: It's been fun
[6/18/17, 10:17:21 AM] Suyash: Sweet
[6/18/17, 10:17:25 AM] Akshay: Came to this place called Gulmarg
[6/18/17, 10:17:36 AM] Akshay: Scenic
[6/18/17, 10:18:36 AM] Akshay: Today went on a cable car ride etc. From the highest access point my sister and dad went up a bit more, it seems a local guide there showed them part of the border
[6/18/17, 10:18:41 AM] Akshay: About 20-30 km away
[6/18/17, 10:19:34 AM] Akshay: It seems the place we all went to today is under military control. Open to tourism only by day. People found there at night are shot on sight it seems. Or something like that. Maybe bs
[6/18/17, 10:19:51 AM] Suyash: Damn
[6/18/17, 10:20:44 AM] Akshay: Strangely there was ice on the upper stop of the cable car trip, while the temperature there was only 18 Celsius
[6/18/17, 10:21:11 AM] Akshay: And weather quite unpredictable. In like one minute there was a dense fog, I couldn't even see my parents et al
[6/18/17, 10:21:24 AM] Akshay: Then after like 2 minutes, it was bright, epic sunshine
[6/18/17, 10:22:22 AM] Akshay: Bye
[6/18/17, 10:22:36 AM] Akshay: Lol UAE touched fifty Celsius.

[6/21/17, 7:06:44 AM] Akshay: Finally this hotel has wifi
[6/21/17, 7:07:21 AM] Akshay: Previous hotel didn't have wifi. Government playing games. Cutting signals for security etc, my dad guessed it might be because of violence etc after India pak match
[6/21/17, 7:07:43 AM] Akshay: Andy Murray is losing worse than me right now.‚òπÔ∏è
[6/21/17, 11:05:35 PM] Sunil: Can v play tennis today?

[6/25/17, 7:17:16 AM] Udit: When u cming back?
[6/25/17, 7:17:53 AM] Akshay: Today in the news we see that a family of 5 from Delhi has died on the same ride. Many injured and even trapped on the same ride
[6/25/17, 7:18:08 AM] Akshay: It seems a large tree fell and snapped the cable
[6/25/17, 7:18:26 AM] Akshay: One car actually fell, other cars are stuck mid air
[6/25/17, 7:19:00 AM] Akshay: Feels especially sad and wierd, cause just last week I was on it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇüò¢
[6/25/17, 7:19:10 AM] Akshay: Coming to Dubai on 7 Aug
[6/25/17, 7:19:29 AM] Akshay: India seems weird idk, seems like all the news is bad only
[6/25/17, 7:19:47 AM] Akshay: It seems like our Kashmir trip was great because we avoided all problems
[6/25/17, 7:20:01 AM] Akshay: Just today some massive militant attack in srinagar
[6/25/17, 7:20:12 AM] Akshay: Terrorists hiding in a DPS school etc

[6/25/17, 9:25:38 AM] Suyash: Yup, read about this
[6/25/17, 9:26:05 AM] Suyash: The tanker thing in Pakistan is even more fucked up
[6/25/17, 9:26:14 AM] Akshay: Yeah 140 people
[6/25/17, 9:26:23 AM] Sunil: Oh yeah
[6/25/17, 9:26:25 AM] Akshay: To merely be alive is very very lucky
[6/25/17, 9:26:26 AM] Sunil: Crazy
[6/25/17, 9:26:53 AM] Suyash: Tanker crashes, and ppl rush in to fetch loose barells of petrol
[6/25/17, 9:27:24 AM] Suyash: Unknowing of the ridiculous danger, flammability
[6/25/17, 9:27:37 AM] Akshay: The depths of mankind's greedy stupidity...
[6/25/17, 9:27:45 AM] Suyash: Yup
[6/25/17, 9:28:52 AM] Suyash: Perhaps ignorance, lack of education, logic stronger than greed
[6/25/17, 9:36:30 AM] Akshay: That's true from the point of view of the danger
[6/25/17, 9:36:56 AM] Akshay: But just the messed up priorities too
[6/25/17, 9:37:19 AM] Akshay: I mean, a big tanker has just crashed, why would you be first worried about the petrol
[6/25/17, 9:53:56 AM] Suyash: Right
[6/25/17, 10:15:14 AM] Udit: Hey guys I hv changed my number to 0522558202

[6/30/17, 6:47:34 AM] Suyash: So you had to hang on to the zip line and pull yourself forward?
[6/30/17, 6:49:52 AM] Akshay: Lol it seems Bhojpuri is a recognized maurisian language
[6/30/17, 6:49:57 AM] Akshay: Rahul man
[6/30/17, 6:50:17 AM] Akshay: Don't exert your fragile bod

[7/12/17, 8:01:52 AM] Sunil: So who r u supporting now ?
[7/12/17, 8:02:16 AM] Akshay: Berdych, raonic, Muller, querrey
[7/12/17, 8:02:27 AM] Akshay: Berdych probs
[7/12/17, 8:02:34 AM] Sunil: In that order ?
[7/12/17, 8:03:12 AM] Akshay: No no
[7/12/17, 8:03:19 AM] Akshay: Not really thought of it
[7/12/17, 8:03:26 AM] Akshay: I hope muller goes ahead though
[7/12/17, 8:06:16 AM] Akshay: Sunil obviously supports fed
[7/12/17, 8:06:21 AM] Akshay: Rahul same I think
[7/12/17, 8:06:26 AM] Akshay: Suyash?
[7/12/17, 8:06:35 AM] Akshay: Nadal out, so maybe raonic?
[7/12/17, 8:06:38 AM] Akshay: Or berdych
[7/12/17, 8:07:17 AM] Akshay: Where are u all right now, who's in Dubai, Chennai et al
[7/12/17, 8:07:23 AM] Sunil: Yes Akshay
[7/12/17, 8:07:33 AM] Sunil: I'm still in Chennai
[7/12/17, 8:07:43 AM] Akshay: What do you do these days
[7/12/17, 8:07:47 AM] Sunil: Will be returning to Dubai in a few days
[7/12/17, 8:07:56 AM] Akshay: Nice
[7/12/17, 8:08:12 AM] Sunil: Been visiting relatives mostly
[7/12/17, 9:20:19 AM] Suyash: I will support Djokovic now
[7/12/17, 9:20:31 AM] Suyash: Ffs Muller lost, Nadal curse
[7/12/17, 9:20:39 AM] Suyash: Federer cruising
[7/12/17, 9:37:46 AM] Rahul: Federer shall win because I say so
[7/12/17, 9:41:54 AM] Akshay: Federer shall win regardless of your opinion!
[7/12/17, 9:42:06 AM] Akshay: It is the law of this planet-some people have all the fortune
[7/12/17, 9:42:17 AM] Akshay: Raonic man, he isn't playing his best
[7/12/17, 9:54:22 AM] Sunil: It's not only about the fortune man
[7/12/17, 9:55:05 AM] Sunil: Federer has been successful for such a long time since he relies on skill
[7/12/17, 9:55:14 AM] Akshay: No no, that's obvious yeah
[7/12/17, 9:55:52 AM] Akshay: All tennis players rely on skill-so it helps if you are the most skilful and ridiculously talented person to ever hold a raquet
[7/12/17, 9:56:02 AM] Akshay: I'm not suggesting he doesn't work on his game.
[7/12/17, 9:56:27 AM] Akshay: But all the players work very hard, few have exceptional qualities-Federer surely one of them
[7/12/17, 9:57:14 AM] Akshay: And for God knows what reason, most of these guys who play Fed don't play well against him
[7/12/17, 9:57:20 AM] Akshay: Just look at dimi the other day
[7/12/17, 9:57:42 AM] Akshay: He pushed rafa so hard in australian open, he beats Murray with reasonable ease
[7/12/17, 9:57:46 AM] Akshay: Against Fed, nothing
[7/12/17, 9:58:24 AM] Suyash: Shit Djokovic injured
[7/12/17, 9:58:38 AM] Akshay: Obviously Federer is better because he doesn't allow them to play their best, but I feel except for Nadal, Djokovic, Murray-no one else has really understood how to play federer. Mental and physical
[7/12/17, 9:58:51 AM] Sunil: True
[7/12/17, 9:58:59 AM] Akshay: Allez berdych
[7/12/17, 9:59:04 AM] Akshay: Been around for sooo long
[7/12/17, 9:59:06 AM] Suyash: Djokovic is the only one left to challenge
[7/12/17, 9:59:14 AM] Akshay: Deserves to beat djok and fed and get to final!
[7/12/17, 9:59:44 AM] Akshay: Obviously even if he gets through Djokovic, Federer will probably bagel him on Fridayüò¢
[7/12/17, 9:59:50 AM] Sunil: I'm not that big a fan of berdych
[7/12/17, 10:00:12 AM] Suyash: Same, he's been cunty
[7/12/17, 10:00:20 AM] Sunil: Exactly
[7/12/17, 10:00:24 AM] Akshay: When?
[7/12/17, 10:00:31 AM] Akshay: What's this I don't know of...
[7/12/17, 10:00:36 AM] Akshay: Anything recently?
[7/12/17, 10:01:00 AM] Suyash: I saw a couple YouTube videos a while back
[7/12/17, 10:01:22 AM] Akshay: Some controversy against Nadal in 2005
[7/12/17, 10:01:32 AM] Akshay: I think I've heard of that
[7/12/17, 10:01:45 AM] Akshay: Also once refused to shake hands with almagro
[7/12/17, 10:01:57 AM] Akshay: Just cause almagro hit the ball at him when at the ney
[7/12/17, 10:01:59 AM] Akshay: Net
[7/12/17, 10:02:04 AM] Akshay: 2012 Australian open I think
[7/12/17, 10:02:36 AM] Akshay: But if cunts are being discussed, fed is probably one of the biggest, though hardly anyone notices lol
[7/12/17, 10:02:57 AM] Akshay: Ok not one of the biggest, but he has done some weird stuff
[7/12/17, 10:03:18 AM] Suyash: Djoko looking hopeless now
[7/12/17, 10:04:25 AM] Sunil: But still a bit early to write him off
[7/12/17, 10:07:36 AM] Suyash: Lol broken
[7/12/17, 10:10:11 AM] Akshay: Not too early to write him off
[7/12/17, 10:10:17 AM] Akshay: He's written himself off
[7/12/17, 10:11:17 AM] Sunil: Shit
[7/12/17, 10:11:20 AM] Sunil: Just saw
[7/12/17, 10:11:23 AM] Sunil: Lol
[7/12/17, 10:11:30 AM] Sunil: Didn't see that coming
[7/12/17, 10:12:07 AM] Akshay: Berdych good job winning that tiebreak
[7/12/17, 10:12:17 AM] Akshay: I bet if Djokovic won it, he wouldn't have stopped lol
[7/12/17, 10:12:48 AM] Sunil: Yea
[7/12/17, 10:13:13 AM] Suyash: Any odds of Raonic winning?
[7/12/17, 10:13:46 AM] Akshay: Lol
[7/12/17, 10:14:05 AM] Akshay: By the way, Murray retains number 1 rank after Wimbledon lol
[7/12/17, 10:14:20 AM] Akshay: Only way was if Nadal won tournament and he didn't reach semi
[7/12/17, 10:14:29 AM] Akshay: Or Djokovic win and he didn't reach semi
[7/12/17, 10:14:40 AM] Suyash: Fkin Muller
[7/12/17, 10:14:43 AM] Akshay: Or wawrinka I think too
[7/12/17, 10:14:48 AM] Suyash: Just there to spoil the party
[7/12/17, 10:14:48 AM] Akshay: Man Muller
[7/12/17, 10:15:00 AM] Akshay: Exactly the kind of player I like :")
[7/12/17, 10:15:20 AM] Akshay: Brave, slightly old, underdog-comes up over the best champion in a marathon match
[7/12/17, 10:15:25 AM] Akshay: Brilliant, stuff of dreams
[7/12/17, 10:15:52 AM] Akshay: Querrey also. Amazing tennis. Murray, even though my favourite, was nowhere near good enough this tournament, and this whole year actually
[7/12/17, 10:16:00 AM] Suyash: Can Cilic beat Federer?
[7/12/17, 10:16:08 AM] Akshay: He could
[7/12/17, 10:16:11 AM] Akshay: He's playing epic
[7/12/17, 10:16:14 AM] Akshay: But last yr
[7/12/17, 10:16:31 AM] Akshay: He had match points against him and then lost
[7/12/17, 10:16:37 AM] Suyash: Damn
[7/12/17, 10:16:43 AM] Suyash: What event?
[7/12/17, 10:17:10 AM] Akshay: Same
[7/12/17, 10:17:12 AM] Akshay: QF
[7/12/17, 10:17:46 AM] Suyash: Oh wow
[7/12/17, 10:23:56 AM] Suyash: Ffs
[7/12/17, 10:24:13 AM] Akshay: Ffs everyone who should have won as per my wishes today lost
[7/12/17, 10:24:18 AM] Akshay: Except berdych
[7/12/17, 10:26:42 AM] Akshay: Fed 100 Wimbledon matches
[7/12/17, 10:26:47 AM] Akshay: Played
[7/12/17, 10:28:27 AM] Sunil: Exact opposite for me lol üòÖüòÇ
[7/12/17, 10:32:11 AM] Akshay: The decision is to support Tomas berdych for this tournament
[7/12/17, 10:32:32 AM] Akshay: Probably querrey for the other match, so that it becomes easier for berdych in the final
[7/12/17, 10:32:37 AM] Akshay: üòá
[7/13/17, 11:10:48 PM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/13/17, 11:11:03 PM] Udit: Ok....
[7/14/17, 5:16:16 AM] Akshay: What the...
[7/14/17, 5:45:21 AM] Akshay: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/first-male-player?bffbmain&ref=bffbmain&utm_term=.tgNvWk8a#.bgBl0YZO
[7/14/17, 5:45:29 AM] Akshay: I call this kind of stuff bs
[7/14/17, 5:46:03 AM] Suyash: Yup a big deal out of nothing
[7/14/17, 5:46:04 AM] Akshay: Even if I'm a Murray fan and agree he's a good sportsperson, role model et al, I don't see this as a big deal
[7/14/17, 5:46:26 AM] Suyash: To salvage some pathetic British pride after Wimbledon defeat
[7/14/17, 5:46:39 AM] Akshay: Well said, exactly my thought just now !
[7/14/17, 5:46:59 AM] Suyash: Wimbledon traditions etc are total BS
[7/14/17, 5:49:32 AM] Akshay: Yeah
[7/14/17, 5:49:50 AM] Akshay: Made players change their underwear that was slightly visible due to perspiration et al
[7/14/17, 5:50:16 AM] Akshay: Especially for ladies man. I think it's humiliating for anyone, but probably worse for them
[7/14/17, 5:50:34 AM] Suyash: Yeah I heard about that
[7/14/17, 5:50:53 AM] Akshay: Why can't people just wear what they want, atleast inside? I think it's ok to have an all white external dress code
[7/14/17, 5:51:02 AM] Suyash: The origins of the dress code itself is related to the second statement
[7/14/17, 5:51:00 AM] Akshay: Just keep the rules
[7/14/17, 5:51:06 AM] Akshay: Like cricket test matches
[7/14/17, 5:51:21 AM] Akshay: But it's based on archaic views
[7/14/17, 5:51:49 AM] Akshay: The same player who wins Wimbledon will probably come to the winner's party wearing any random revealing outfit
[7/14/17, 5:52:03 AM] Suyash: Yup
[7/14/17, 5:52:20 AM] Akshay: And well, Wimbledon doesn't exactly happen in India lol :")
[7/14/17, 5:52:32 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/14/17, 5:59:57 AM] Suyash: Querrey damn
[7/14/17, 6:03:20 AM] Akshay: May all the power be with Tomas berdych
[7/14/17, 6:40:27 AM] Suyash: Definitely
[7/14/17, 7:38:10 AM] Suyash: Cilic has to be the player with the most number of ball bounces before serving! Annoying :")
[7/14/17, 9:48:22 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/14/17, 9:49:55 AM] Suyash: Why so?
[7/14/17, 9:50:37 AM] Akshay: As in, epic
[7/14/17, 9:50:47 AM] Akshay: Epic comeback
[7/14/17, 9:51:42 AM] Suyash: Yes definitely
[7/14/17, 10:05:20 AM] Akshay: In a few years time, the generations that got to see Federer playing live will be considered exceptional lucky
[7/14/17, 10:05:35 AM] Akshay: It is difficult to imagine there will be someone similar later
[7/14/17, 10:05:45 AM] Akshay: Although that invariably will happen
[7/14/17, 10:06:07 AM] Akshay: Like 4-5 min ago he hit an exceptional flick backhand pass
[7/14/17, 10:52:21 AM] Sunil: Fed vs cilic final
[7/14/17, 10:52:25 AM] Akshay: I shall pray day and night for Marin Cilic
[7/14/17, 10:52:33 AM] Akshay: Ffs Federer
[7/14/17, 10:52:36 AM] Akshay: Humble brag
[7/14/17, 10:52:43 AM] Sunil: I'll do the same for Federer lol
[7/14/17, 10:52:51 AM] Akshay: "Life after tennis more important than this"
[7/14/17, 10:52:57 AM] Sunil: Lol y so much hate man
[7/14/17, 10:52:57 AM] Akshay: Although true
[7/14/17, 10:53:04 AM] Akshay: It just seems weird he says this stuff
[7/14/17, 10:53:18 AM] Akshay: Cause every player will give their life to be where Fed is
[7/14/17, 11:19:48 AM] Akshay: https://www.google.co.in/amp/metro.co.uk/2017/07/14/twitter-goes-into-meltdown-when-novak-djokovics-face-is-spotted-on-tomas-berdychs-shoes-6780513/amp/
[7/14/17, 12:14:24 PM] Suyash: üòÇ Crazy :")
[7/14/17, 11:08:10 PM] Akshay: Rahul are you in Bangalore or dubai
[7/15/17, 12:10:39 AM] Suyash: He's in Dubai
[7/15/17, 12:10:44 AM] Suyash: Guys squash today?
[7/15/17, 12:12:52 AM] Udit: Sure thing
[7/15/17, 12:12:52 AM] Udit: 4/5?
[7/15/17, 1:19:33 AM] Suyash: okay
[7/15/17, 1:20:21 AM] Suyash: 4?
[7/15/17, 1:24:15 AM] Udit: Alright
[7/15/17, 1:25:31 AM] Udit: Let me ask ajinkya
[7/15/17, 1:51:34 AM] Udit: Yup 4
[7/15/17, 1:51:39 AM] Udit: Get the ball
[7/15/17, 1:53:59 AM] Akshay: Wish I could be there
[7/15/17, 1:54:03 AM] Akshay: üòü
[7/15/17, 1:54:17 AM] Akshay: Drop-shoting udit
[7/15/17, 1:54:23 AM] Akshay: Lobbing suyash
[7/15/17, 1:54:30 AM] Akshay: Getting aced badly by all
[7/15/17, 1:59:57 AM] Suyash: Yup, we need more variety
[7/15/17, 2:00:25 AM] Suyash: Nowadays, too few ppl for doubles even
[7/15/17, 2:04:11 AM] Akshay: Damn
[7/15/17, 2:07:57 AM] Udit: Yup miss doubles
[7/15/17, 2:15:25 AM] Udit: Suyash know anyone else
[7/15/17, 2:20:53 AM] Suyash: Ambuj is in India
[7/15/17, 2:21:01 AM] Suyash: @16147173352 can you come?
[7/15/17, 2:27:11 AM] Udit: Hmm
[7/15/17, 3:27:15 AM] Rahul: I'm not sure, I can probably come - not much use confirming so late so if I'm not coming I'll text at around 3:30 or else I'll just show up there
[7/16/17, 5:06:30 AM] Akshay: Only a very slight hope exists because it's only cilic standing on Federer's road
[7/16/17, 5:06:57 AM] Akshay: Maybe if it was Djokovic or Nadal, it would be easier to believe that fed can be beaten!
[7/16/17, 6:27:53 AM] Akshay: Promising start from cilic
[7/16/17, 6:28:05 AM] Akshay: Are you'll watching
[7/16/17, 6:42:19 AM] Akshay: Ffs
[7/16/17, 6:47:57 AM] Suyash: Lol too soon!
[7/16/17, 6:48:13 AM] Suyash: Started watching with promise at break point Cilic
[7/16/17, 6:48:28 AM] Akshay: Yup definitely
[7/16/17, 6:48:42 AM] Akshay: Roger fuckerer as usual leads
[7/16/17, 6:48:50 AM] Suyash: Yup good one üòÇ
[7/16/17, 6:50:40 AM] Akshay: Like Novak Cheatovic
[7/16/17, 6:50:50 AM] Akshay: (Based on recent rumours lol)
[7/16/17, 6:51:04 AM] Akshay: I read these funny nicknames somewhere
[7/16/17, 6:51:17 AM] Akshay: Though the Fed one is easy to come up with :")
[7/16/17, 6:51:35 AM] Suyash: Why cheat for Novak?
[7/16/17, 6:52:07 AM] Akshay: Due to rumours of "problems in his marriage"
[7/16/17, 6:52:17 AM] Akshay: Et al
[7/16/17, 6:52:27 AM] Suyash: Ah okay
[7/16/17, 6:52:54 AM] Akshay: Some guy had written Rafael Needle
[7/16/17, 6:52:59 AM] Akshay: For doping :")
[7/16/17, 6:53:05 AM] Akshay: Indirect but good haha
[7/16/17, 6:53:32 AM] Akshay: The court seriously needs to be extended by 3-4 metres right now for cilic
[7/16/17, 6:53:39 AM] Akshay: Hitting everything way out
[7/16/17, 6:55:01 AM] Suyash: It'll be a white wash
[7/16/17, 6:56:13 AM] Akshay: Massacre
[7/16/17, 6:56:31 AM] Suyash: He's too nervous
[7/16/17, 6:56:46 AM] Suyash: This year's Wimbledon has been BS
[7/16/17, 6:57:00 AM] Akshay: Hmm. Interesting though
[7/16/17, 6:57:13 AM] Akshay: Good on Sam querrey, cilic, berdych
[7/16/17, 6:57:16 AM] Akshay: All did great
[7/16/17, 6:57:34 AM] Suyash: Djoko, Murray injured
[7/16/17, 6:57:40 AM] Suyash: No one turned up, Muller lucks out
[7/16/17, 6:58:14 AM] Suyash: No else can compete with Federer, leaving it one sided
[7/16/17, 7:00:12 AM] Akshay: Muller played great man
[7/16/17, 7:00:49 AM] Akshay: Obviously luck is needed to make this kind of performance at a slam
[7/16/17, 7:01:39 AM] Akshay: He was maybe especially lucky this tournament, but you're feeling it cause he threw Nadal out :")
[7/16/17, 7:01:59 AM] Akshay: Murray, Djokovic agreed. Not in shape to stop or even temporarily hinder Federer
[7/16/17, 7:02:16 AM] Akshay: Wawrinka nothing to talk about
[7/16/17, 7:02:29 AM] Akshay: Berdych did great though
[7/16/17, 7:05:52 AM] Suyash: I stopped watching
[7/16/17, 7:05:56 AM] Suyash: Cilic crying?
[7/16/17, 7:06:14 AM] Akshay: It seemed like
[7/16/17, 7:06:15 AM] Akshay: Idm
[7/16/17, 7:06:17 AM] Akshay: Idk*
[7/16/17, 7:06:31 AM] Akshay: He also called an injury timeout
[7/16/17, 7:08:37 AM] Akshay: This is humiliating tbh
[7/16/17, 7:08:59 AM] Suyash: Yup
[7/16/17, 7:09:11 AM] Akshay: Even Federer's mis-hits landing in at times
[7/16/17, 7:09:18 AM] Suyash: He should fake an injury to retire, like others this tournament
[7/16/17, 7:09:26 AM] Akshay: Nah
[7/16/17, 7:09:41 AM] Akshay: If he loses fighting, we can still respect him
[7/16/17, 7:09:48 AM] Suyash: Give the Fed crowd what they want :")
[7/16/17, 7:10:15 AM] Akshay: If he retires, it'll be weird cause everyone knows it's because of the score
[7/16/17, 7:10:22 AM] Akshay: Not really injury
[7/16/17, 7:10:47 AM] Suyash: His service is blazing, but can't stay in rallies
[7/16/17, 7:11:02 AM] Akshay: He's looking completely clueless
[7/16/17, 7:11:02 AM] Akshay: Doesn't know what to do, trying to serve volley on second serve
[7/16/17, 7:11:20 AM] Akshay: "Bottom line-he's getting hammered"
[7/16/17, 7:11:24 AM] Akshay: Commentators lol
[7/16/17, 7:11:26 AM] Akshay: No mercy
[7/16/17, 7:11:50 AM] Suyash: Yup
[7/16/17, 7:12:18 AM] Akshay: Alright boys. Cilic is done chilling
[7/16/17, 7:12:26 AM] Akshay: The stuff of champions begins now
[7/16/17, 7:12:43 AM] Akshay: Come back from two sets down to storm to a Wimbledon title against the GOAT :")
[7/16/17, 7:12:55 AM] Akshay: All part of his script!
[7/16/17, 7:14:02 AM] Suyash: https://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/no-federer-no-nadal-a-look-at-the-2004-french-open/
[7/16/17, 7:14:06 AM] Suyash: This is needed
[7/16/17, 7:18:20 AM] Akshay: Haha. It happened last yr at French open and US open I think

[7/16/17, 8:53:51 AM] Sunil: How tough is it
[7/16/17, 8:53:53 AM] Rahul: *good
[7/16/17, 8:54:34 AM] Rahul: It's easy to hit a few good shots, even really good ones as a beginner but it's really hard to get the technique spot on
[7/16/17, 8:54:45 AM] Sunil: Hmm okay
[7/16/17, 8:54:52 AM] Rahul: You get more consistent as your technique gets better
[7/18/17, 12:15:08 AM] Suyash: Play today?

[7/23/17, 6:51:10 AM] Akshay: Did you'll know that Mr. Sanjay Gupta passed away?
[7/23/17, 6:51:14 AM] Akshay: Saw on Facebook
[7/23/17, 6:51:20 AM] Akshay: Sad
[7/23/17, 6:51:49 AM] Akshay: I met him at school in early june, he was running around with exam timetables as always
[7/23/17, 7:29:40 AM] Suyash: Yup, sad, unexpected
[7/23/17, 8:12:04 AM] Sunil: Very sad indeed üò¢
[7/23/17, 8:18:58 AM] Akshay: https://youtu.be/YTkVrlksDus
[7/23/17, 8:18:59 AM] Akshay: We all know these kids now
[7/23/17, 8:55:53 AM] Udit: Yeah...so sad man 
He taught me for a bit in 11th
[7/23/17, 9:40:08 AM] Akshay: I realised that
[7/23/17, 9:40:42 AM] Akshay: India have lost
[7/23/17, 9:40:54 AM] Akshay: Tough to see, but great performance
[7/23/17, 9:41:08 AM] Akshay: choked at the end, reason they lost
[7/23/17, 9:43:08 AM] Rahul: Man I was supporting England
[7/23/17, 9:43:17 AM] Rahul: They had some babes one their team
[7/23/17, 9:43:31 AM] Rahul: *on
[7/23/17, 9:45:30 AM] Akshay: Man
[7/23/17, 9:45:49 AM] Akshay: Of all the people in this group, rahul is the only one who is capable of completely missing the point
[7/23/17, 9:46:15 AM] Rahul: I know
[7/23/17, 9:46:23 AM] Rahul: It's a different way of thinking
[7/26/17, 5:44:00 AM] Sunil: 25 best engineering colleges in India for the year 2017 - Slideshows | Gadgetsnow - http://www.gadgetsnow.com/slideshows/25-best-engineering-colleges-in-india-for-the-year-2017/photolist/57995007.cms?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_campaign=GNWap&utm_medium=referral
[7/26/17, 5:44:21 AM] Sunil: Interesting article
[7/26/17, 6:28:12 AM] Rahul: Anna university number 8 dam
[7/26/17, 6:28:34 AM] Rahul: I used to live close to it - my cousins went there
[7/26/17, 6:53:51 AM] Rahul: Man I'm kinda pissed at Emirates - cunts make the economy to US so nice compared to India. I was dam surprised - the screen is so close to your face and there are so many ppl dry humping each other to get to their seats. Extremely claustrophobic.
[7/26/17, 6:54:40 AM] Akshay: Yup that's always been the case
[7/26/17, 6:54:53 AM] Akshay: Indians are pissed off about it for long
[7/26/17, 6:55:11 AM] Akshay: Especially since emirates doesn't make the prices much lower to india
[7/26/17, 6:55:16 AM] Rahul: Didn't know that it's the first time I flew economy to India
[7/26/17, 6:55:18 AM] Akshay: Because they have extremely high demand
[7/26/17, 6:55:37 AM] Suyash: The price is fairly low to India
[7/26/17, 6:55:43 AM] Akshay: For example, emirates flight to say, Kochi or Mumbai is always full
[7/26/17, 6:56:09 AM] Akshay: It's fairly low, but if you consider the distance and compare it with costs of flights to US, it is extremely high
[7/26/17, 6:56:28 AM] Akshay: They have no reason to drop it significantly because the want for tickets is always there
[7/26/17, 6:56:39 AM] Akshay: Tbh all flights to India are shitty
[7/26/17, 6:56:58 AM] Rahul: Baba they're all cheap and it was a bad sight
[7/26/17, 6:56:59 AM] Akshay: Indigo probably best. Air arabia is ok, but going through sharjah airport is bs
[7/26/17, 6:57:24 AM] Rahul: Baba but Emirates business or upgrade lesson had been learnt
[7/26/17, 6:57:34 AM] Rahul: *buy, has
[7/26/17, 6:57:45 AM] Akshay: Ahhh the prodigal son
[7/26/17, 6:58:07 AM] Akshay: Why worry about these details when all you have to do is whip out your fat purse and upgrade :")
[7/26/17, 6:58:30 AM] Rahul: Because we had to change the flight last minute for arriving early for some function
[7/26/17, 6:58:35 AM] Rahul: No space in business
[7/26/17, 6:58:42 AM] Akshay: I told my dad, for the last US trip in 4th yr, he should buy business class for me
[7/26/17, 6:58:51 AM] Rahul: We booked business only
[7/26/17, 6:59:03 AM] Akshay: That would be a good gift!
[7/26/17, 6:59:30 AM] Rahul: Is that what you want üòÇ
[7/26/17, 6:59:40 AM] Akshay: My parents have never booked business class tickets for us. My sister, mother and I got upgraded for free once-because of a full flight
[7/26/17, 6:59:44 AM] Akshay: It was absolutely amazing
[7/26/17, 6:59:48 AM] Rahul: It's more leg space and access to the bar
[7/26/17, 6:59:57 AM] Akshay: The leg space is epic
[7/26/17, 6:59:59 AM] Rahul: And big screen
[7/26/17, 7:00:19 AM] Akshay: I've only been once, basically-a cherished memory
[7/26/17, 7:01:43 AM] Rahul: üòëthere are better things to cherish
[7/26/17, 7:02:08 AM] Akshay: True-but obviously depends on how many times you have done something
[7/26/17, 7:02:18 AM] Akshay: Like you go very rarely on economy yeah?
[7/26/17, 7:02:44 AM] Rahul: Exactly - I didn't cherish economy
[7/26/17, 7:02:55 AM] Rahul: Nor will I remember it for more than a year
[7/26/17, 7:03:35 AM] Akshay: Nothing to cherish on economy!
[7/26/17, 7:03:40 AM] Akshay: But business is good ofc
[7/26/17, 7:03:56 AM] Rahul: In a year it will be a bad thing that happened because it had to
[7/26/17, 7:04:14 AM] Akshay: Business class is much more expensive
[7/26/17, 7:04:22 AM] Akshay: My parents checked for coming to india
[7/26/17, 7:04:41 AM] Rahul: Some 3000 bucks for ppl I'm guessing
[7/26/17, 7:04:55 AM] Akshay: To Bangalore economy Emirates was like 3.5k, business close to 8
[7/26/17, 7:05:27 AM] Akshay: As a measure - my sister's tickets to NYC in August have been booked on Emirates economy for 4.6k
[7/26/17, 7:05:41 AM] Akshay: So comparing the flights, the India one is pretty expensive
[7/26/17, 7:06:11 AM] Suyash: Woah, India economy is usually 1500 on Emirates
[7/26/17, 7:06:11 AM] Akshay: Business class to NYC- 11k- whopping!
[7/26/17, 7:06:19 AM] Rahul: This is why you collect miles lol
[7/26/17, 7:06:27 AM] Akshay: Which city do you fly to suyash
[7/26/17, 7:06:37 AM] Akshay: It's been a few years since that 1500:")
[7/26/17, 7:06:44 AM] Akshay: Especially for south india
[7/26/17, 7:06:47 AM] Suyash: Delhi
[7/26/17, 7:07:01 AM] Suyash: True, haven't flown in a while
[7/26/17, 7:07:19 AM] Akshay: I definitely think Dubai to south India connections are expensive-every year my family has this discussion at least once
[7/26/17, 7:07:28 AM] Akshay: With my sister demanding Emirates
[7/26/17, 7:07:33 AM] Akshay: Mother says save a bit
[7/26/17, 7:07:37 AM] Akshay: Dad says save a lot
[7/26/17, 7:07:57 AM] Akshay: And I say - fuck all this bs- get me business class legroom
[7/26/17, 7:08:43 AM] Rahul: You fly 3 round trips to US I think you get enough miles to upgrade to India
[7/26/17, 7:09:02 AM] Akshay: It depends on which card you have though
[7/26/17, 7:09:12 AM] Akshay: My dad said something like that
[7/26/17, 7:09:23 AM] Akshay: If you have platinum, it's the best I think, right?
[7/26/17, 7:09:23 AM] Rahul: That's small
[7/26/17, 7:09:31 AM] Rahul: It depends more on how much you fly
[7/26/17, 7:09:36 AM] Akshay: Yeah
[7/26/17, 7:09:43 AM] Rahul: You get the platinum by flying more in the first place
[7/26/17, 7:09:53 AM] Akshay: But you probably get your upgrades because your dad flies so much
[7/26/17, 7:09:53 AM] Rahul: And credit cards help
[7/26/17, 7:10:11 AM] Akshay: And his official trips are all probably on business class that's paid for by IBM
[7/26/17, 7:10:23 AM] Rahul: We buy business to India upgrade to US
[7/26/17, 7:10:23 AM] Akshay: Thereby entering a profitable cycle for the family :")
[7/26/17, 7:10:50 AM] Rahul: My dad gets paid by IBM for first flights when he goes solo
[7/26/17, 7:10:57 AM] Akshay: Fly business, long distance-more points-fly more-more points-platinum card-more upgrades et al
[7/26/17, 7:11:13 AM] Rahul: Yup
[7/26/17, 7:11:28 AM] Rahul: But there are branches to this cycle
[7/26/17, 7:11:36 AM] Akshay: My dad's company has a rule that business class is only for flights above 4 hrs
[7/26/17, 7:11:45 AM] Akshay: So rest he has to go economy
[7/26/17, 7:12:19 AM] Akshay: And the caveat to the rule is, if business-it must be the cheapest business class ticket-meaning they could book him on airlines other than Emirates
[7/26/17, 7:12:24 AM] Akshay: He hates the scheme
[7/26/17, 7:13:02 AM] Rahul: Woah lol
[7/26/17, 7:14:17 AM] Rahul: If u get a Citibank premier credit card u get 1 mile for each dollar spent
[7/26/17, 7:14:50 AM] Rahul: Pay your rent with the credit card, upgrade family for trips to India for a year
[7/26/17, 7:15:48 AM] Rahul: And if u get a platinum card u get to give one family member/ friend a gold card
[7/26/17, 7:16:17 AM] Rahul: Which increases chances of being upgraded for free on a booked flight
[7/26/17, 7:26:23 AM] Akshay: Ahh will pass the tips on to the people in power
[7/26/17, 7:26:32 AM] Akshay: As in, my mum and dad
[7/26/17, 9:03:29 PM] Rahul: Man this place is so stupid. Today morning I went to apply for my aadhar card. The place was supposed to open at 8 but by 7:45 there was already a big ass queue. I stood in the line for 1 hour and 20 mins thinking I would walk out of there with the card. The office ppl were apparently stuck in traffic so the line didn't move till then. Then one lady comes and opens the office. 20 mins later 5 guys also enter the office. They stand outside chatting for a while, laughing, joking. Then they start giving these chits of paper. I was wondering what the fuck that is. Then when my turn in the queue came he explained to me - "today no possible, some praablem is there, we giving appaaintment". My appointment is on Saturday at 11 AM.üò°
[7/26/17, 9:05:18 PM] Udit: Lol
[7/26/17, 9:05:21 PM] Rahul: Instead of paying these dum asses they could automate the thing - go to a kiosk get your appointment and get out
[7/26/17, 9:05:22 PM] Udit: U here then applt for pan card as well
[7/26/17, 9:05:26 PM] Udit: Apply
[7/26/17, 9:05:32 PM] Rahul: I already got
[7/26/17, 9:06:04 PM] Rahul: Now I am getting aadhar also because this govt is allowing NRIs also to get
[7/26/17, 9:06:10 PM] Udit: Oh alright
[7/26/17, 9:06:25 PM] Udit: Yup its imp shit now
[7/26/17, 9:06:28 PM] Rahul: PAN u can get from Dubai only through an agency, physical presence not required
[7/26/17, 9:06:30 PM] Udit: Use it everywhere
[7/26/17, 9:06:44 PM] Rahul: Yeah
[7/26/17, 9:07:00 PM] Udit: I got it frm india
[7/26/17, 9:07:01 PM] Udit: Like w days back
[7/26/17, 9:07:20 PM] Rahul: Once they link the PAN and aadhar and stuff it'll be pretty cool tho
[7/26/17, 9:07:37 PM] Udit: Yup
[7/26/17, 9:09:41 PM] Udit: Btw india stopped production of 2000 rupee notes
[7/26/17, 9:09:45 PM] Udit: And are about start smaller tender notes
[7/26/17, 9:09:53 PM] Udit: Like 200
[7/26/17, 9:33:48 PM] Akshay: I have PAN number
[7/26/17, 9:34:00 PM] Akshay: My parents applied only two months ago
[7/26/17, 9:34:12 PM] Akshay: For me
[7/26/17, 9:34:25 PM] Akshay: Not sure what is the fuss about aadhar
[7/26/17, 9:39:36 PM] Udit: Its like a brp
[7/26/17, 9:40:10 PM] Udit: So u dont need to carry passport for identity proof
[7/26/17, 9:43:33 PM] Rahul: I heard they might even disallow the 2000 rupee in a few months
[7/26/17, 9:44:18 PM] Udit: yeah bcos there is a very low peecent in circulation
[7/26/17, 9:44:21 PM] Rahul: Demonetisation part 2üòú
[7/26/17, 9:44:25 PM] Udit: So they might
[7/26/17, 9:44:31 PM] Udit: Yeah ik!
[7/26/17, 9:46:44 PM] Rahul: That shit was so bad. Overnight literally half the Indian currency most ppl keep became illegal
[7/26/17, 9:48:38 PM] Rahul: And i don't think it was very effective for its main purpose also
[7/27/17, 8:34:14 AM] Akshay: It wasn't
[7/27/17, 9:12:16 AM] Rahul: Aite bro thnx for info where did you get your data from
[7/27/17, 9:13:06 AM] Akshay: Is that message for this group?
[7/27/17, 9:13:31 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[7/27/17, 9:13:54 AM] Akshay: What data are you referring to?
[7/27/17, 9:17:20 AM] Rahul: Newspaper reports, govt data about how much black money was collected
[7/27/17, 9:17:36 AM] Akshay: Oh
[7/27/17, 9:18:01 AM] Akshay: I read an analysis by a fellow of the RICE university Baker Institute
[7/27/17, 9:18:10 AM] Akshay: A political/economic think tank
[7/27/17, 9:18:45 AM] Akshay: This guy called russell green if I remember correctly, is a fellow. He is also a grad econ prof at Rice.
[7/27/17, 9:19:04 AM] Akshay: Before rice he was the US economic ambassador to India or something like that
[7/27/17, 9:19:10 AM] Akshay: He had written a detailed article
[7/27/17, 9:19:23 AM] Rahul: Ahh I see
[7/27/17, 9:20:03 AM] Akshay: Saw the link to the article on this daily email from rice that is called dateline rice
[7/27/17, 9:20:14 AM] Akshay: It's all about rice uni linked stuff on the news etc
[7/27/17, 9:20:21 AM] Akshay: But data exact I don't know
[7/27/17, 9:20:59 AM] Akshay: And tbh even if the entire black money collected was good, it came at a cost that was too high-ie insane suffering for the poor
[7/27/17, 9:22:29 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[7/27/17, 9:22:43 AM] Rahul: Nice article
[7/27/17, 9:23:21 AM] Akshay: Yeah I think it's that
[7/27/17, 9:23:40 AM] Akshay: I thought maybe there is another one too
[7/27/17, 9:23:46 AM] Akshay: But I'm sure I have seen this one
[7/27/17, 11:28:22 AM] Suyash: Bezos richest in the world now

[7/27/17, 9:28:54 PM] Akshay: But I know it was either yesterday, today, or tomorrowüòï
[7/27/17, 9:55:47 PM] Rahul: No no correct date only

[7/30/17, 2:18:39 AM] Akshay: Suyash is this the way it happens?
[7/30/17, 2:24:10 AM] Suyash: Lol must be, the scale is perhaps too complex to think of
[7/30/17, 2:24:32 AM] Suyash: The page rank stuff was in Lin Alg üòÇ
[7/30/17, 6:37:07 AM] Akshay: What are you all doing these days, in India or Dubai, wherever?
[7/30/17, 7:33:04 AM] Udit: Just came back to dubai!
[7/30/17, 7:46:38 AM] Akshay: Cool.

[8/10/17, 12:26:16 AM] Rahul: Kinda fun to play there
[8/10/17, 12:27:52 AM] Suyash: If y'all want, we can not play squash today - just TT at WTC
[8/10/17, 12:28:05 AM] Suyash: And then PS in my house
[8/10/17, 12:28:40 AM] Suyash: Or even football if enough of y'all show up

[8/10/17, 2:36:37 AM] Akshay: But Udit, since there will be 5 of us already, it will be much better if it's just us 5
[8/10/17, 2:37:04 AM] Udit: Yea i booked both the courts
[8/10/17, 2:37:07 AM] Akshay: If your bldg friends do come as well, I feel it would be too crowded on both courts
[8/10/17, 2:37:15 AM] Udit: I dont think that can be a problem
[8/10/17, 2:37:41 AM] Udit: Ahh ok up yo u guys

[8/10/17, 5:20:45 AM] Akshay: 7?
[8/10/17, 5:21:17 AM] Akshay: Man that's too much for one tt table, the ratio of waiting time to playing time isn't optimal
[8/10/17, 5:21:34 AM] Udit: Bro i am here
[8/10/17, 5:22:07 AM] Udit: There are quite a few empty tables
[8/10/17, 5:22:28 AM] Akshay: It's based on booking though
[8/10/17, 5:23:02 AM] Udit: No

[8/10/17, 5:47:00 AM] Akshay: Another day I'll come
[8/10/17, 5:47:37 AM] Akshay: I don't think it's worth the effort for me because I also have to leave soon and be home before 7, so might as well just stay üòÇ

[8/15/17, 3:19:12 AM] Akshay: Sunil and udit can't come
[8/15/17, 3:19:44 AM] Akshay: Mostly today is the last I can play because from tomorrow I'll be more busy packing etc
[8/15/17, 3:20:13 AM] Akshay: Today I can though, for later plans I'll have to confirm on that day
[8/15/17, 4:18:39 AM] Sunil: Change of plans, I can come today üëç

[8/15/17, 4:39:07 AM] Akshay: Its a 10 min brisk walk from business bay metro
[8/15/17, 4:39:16 AM] Suyash: Dropped Pin
near 2 D St - Dubai
https://goo.gl/maps/QKEhKR1bYhR2
[8/15/17, 4:40:38 AM] Sunil: Lol more like 20 minutes man
[8/15/17, 4:41:05 AM] Sunil: It's not that close to the metro
[8/15/17, 4:41:16 AM] Suyash: Take F20 for 3 stops, and then a 3 minute walk
[8/15/17, 4:43:50 AM] Akshay: Ok lads can you'll confirm if you all are coming?
[8/15/17, 4:44:07 AM] Akshay: Just thinking aloud-if we all are playing, just get rahul to come here :")
[8/15/17, 4:44:24 AM] Akshay: Lol sorry rahul, thinking aloud
[8/15/17, 4:47:37 AM] Sunil: I'm in üëç
[8/15/17, 4:47:59 AM] Akshay: Rahul what do you say
[8/15/17, 4:48:31 AM] Suyash: Rahul's also has tennis tho
[8/15/17, 4:48:42 AM] Sunil: True
[8/15/17, 4:48:55 AM] Sunil: That's also going to be fun
[8/15/17, 4:49:25 AM] Akshay: But how serious is tennis though, it's not too fun, udit has two squash courts ‚úåüèæ
[8/15/17, 4:49:56 AM] Akshay: ‚úåüèæ not ‚òùüèæ :")
[8/15/17, 4:50:44 AM] Sunil: I thought you loved tennis ü§î
[8/15/17, 4:51:05 AM] Suyash: Lets settle it on majority vote
[8/15/17, 4:51:46 AM] Akshay: Well, Sunil my love for tennis is akin to how you love tt, subject to certain conditions, including the opposition players, court et al :")
[8/15/17, 4:55:31 AM] Akshay: So who's in favour of rahul's location, who's in favour of udits
[8/15/17, 4:55:58 AM] Akshay: We assume rahul and udit each vote for their own location
[8/15/17, 4:57:05 AM] Akshay: Upon the subconscious self-preservative instinct instilled in all human beings, that prevents them from accepting arrangements in which they themselves have to travel in the sun
[8/15/17, 4:57:46 AM] Akshay: Then, if suyash and Sunil vote for rahuls place, sadly I shall have to lay down my arms and waive the white flag of submission.
[8/15/17, 4:57:50 AM] Akshay: Last call
[8/15/17, 5:01:25 AM] Suyash: still vote for Rahul üòÇ
[8/15/17, 5:02:47 AM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[8/15/17, 5:03:10 AM] Sunil: I guess it's settled then
[8/15/17, 5:03:20 AM] Sunil: See y'all at 5
[8/15/17, 5:03:25 AM] Akshay: Not yet-its based on your vote
[8/15/17, 5:03:39 AM] Udit: Where?
[8/15/17, 5:03:50 AM] Suyash: His vote is implied
[8/15/17, 5:04:10 AM] Udit: Rahuls or mine?
[8/15/17, 5:04:28 AM] Akshay: Rahuls
[8/15/17, 5:04:37 AM] Akshay: Ok
[8/15/17, 5:11:46 AM] Akshay: Everyone who has a squash ball pls bring
[8/15/17, 5:26:17 AM] Rahul: Woah ok lol se you guys at 5
[8/15/17, 5:28:21 AM] Rahul: Come straight to the club I'll meet you all there
[8/15/17, 5:28:30 AM] Rahul: U guys can go in also if u come early
[8/15/17, 10:22:25 AM] Rahul: Badminton tomorrow between 3 and 7?
[8/15/17, 10:23:21 AM] Rahul: Keep playing till the moment comes üòú
[8/15/17, 10:46:04 AM] Suyash: Sure
[8/16/17, 4:51:51 AM] Udit: So, U guys playing today?
[8/16/17, 6:52:10 AM] Rahul: lol didn't play

[8/16/17, 6:53:36 AM] Rahul: My flights at 2 AM day after
[8/16/17, 8:13:41 AM] Suyash: Yup
[8/16/17, 8:17:36 AM] Rahul: Anyone free for badminton, TT at WTC?
[8/16/17, 8:18:07 AM] Sunil: I'll try to come for some time
[8/16/17, 8:18:34 AM] Suyash: How bout in the morning?
[8/16/17, 8:18:41 AM] Sunil: But not too sure
[8/16/17, 8:21:41 AM] Rahul: Would you prefer morning or afternoon?
[8/16/17, 8:28:01 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/16/17, 9:20:46 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/16/17, 9:20:47 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[8/16/17, 9:34:39 AM] Sunil: Lol good job üëç
[8/16/17, 9:45:33 AM] Akshay: Rahul, did u leave lot of clothes there over summer
[8/16/17, 9:45:43 AM] Akshay: I know you won't be taking a tennis kit, or as many sports clothes as I will, but it still looks quite less
[8/16/17, 10:08:13 AM] Suyash: Do they allow 2 backs + Tennis kit + Backpack?
[8/16/17, 10:08:18 AM] Suyash: *bags
[8/16/17, 10:08:44 AM] Akshay: Haha coincidentally, same debate going on right now at home
[8/16/17, 10:09:06 AM] Akshay: So far, I've always packed tennis kit INSIDE one of the check-in bags
[8/16/17, 10:09:21 AM] Akshay: And a backpack on hand
[8/16/17, 10:11:06 AM] Akshay: This time I was wondering if I could do what you asked, keep it separate
[8/16/17, 10:11:31 AM] Suyash: This time at LAX I had 2 checked in, 1 trolley + Backpack
[8/16/17, 10:11:39 AM] Suyash: I had to get a mate to hide it for me :")
[8/16/17, 10:11:50 AM] Suyash: But at dubai, they're chill
[8/16/17, 10:11:49 AM] Akshay: How did he hide it
[8/16/17, 10:12:12 AM] Suyash: They only stop at the check in counter
[8/16/17, 10:12:24 AM] Suyash: Can't do anything about it at the gate
[8/16/17, 10:12:31 AM] Akshay: Ahh
[8/16/17, 10:12:42 AM] Suyash: Emirates in Dubai, very chill
[8/16/17, 10:12:45 AM] Akshay: So how did he hide it
[8/16/17, 10:13:18 AM] Suyash: I had to hide it from the check in woman - she was actively making others pay extra to check in the third
[8/16/17, 10:13:38 AM] Suyash: So just not show up with it, leave the bag aside for a bit
[8/16/17, 10:13:58 AM] Akshay: Nice
[8/16/17, 10:14:38 AM] Rahul: 2 bags less than 23 kg each + backpack allowed I think
[8/16/17, 10:14:40 AM] Rahul: If ur kit is big enough not to fit in ur check in bag then it should be big enough to fit ur backpack
[8/16/17, 10:14:40 AM] Rahul: Put the racquet(s) between clothes and stuff ur backpack in the kit
[8/16/17, 10:14:40 AM] Rahul: *2 bags UPTO 23 kg
[8/16/17, 10:15:33 AM] Suyash: Yeah fitting the back pack in the kit makes sense
[8/16/17, 10:17:02 AM] Rahul: I think Emirates carry on is upto 7 kg also
[8/16/17, 10:17:17 AM] Suyash: Yup
[8/16/17, 10:17:37 AM] Rahul: So I think they'll pass the backpack and the kit too, if it's less
[8/16/17, 10:18:21 AM] Rahul: Not sure tho, the details are in the fine print
[8/16/17, 10:18:51 AM] Suyash: Summer there's too much stuff to fake. Winter there's too less!
[8/16/17, 10:19:40 AM] Akshay: That's what I meant when I said I always packed the kit INSIDE the check in bag. This time I was wondering if I could carry it on hand, as a separate unit. In addition to a backpack on hand.
[8/16/17, 10:20:46 AM] Suyash: rackets + back pack inside the kit bag on hand
[8/16/17, 10:21:14 AM] Akshay: ahh ok. I've tried last yr, the kit isn't wide enough to fit backpack :")
[8/16/17, 10:21:25 AM] Akshay: Plus, backpack necessary on hand to hold essentials
[8/16/17, 10:22:57 AM] Rahul: Man I said backpack in kit bag in hand, kit contents in checked in - not kit in checked in
[8/16/17, 10:23:33 AM] Rahul: Anyway, whatever
[8/16/17, 10:23:51 AM] Akshay: Yes by kit in checked in, I never actually put the kit in completely, I usually have to separate the contents and the bag itself
[8/16/17, 10:24:02 AM] Rahul: Ahh ok
[8/16/17, 10:24:24 AM] Akshay: It would fit alltogether, but then it's not optimized to also fit other stuff
[8/16/17, 10:24:42 AM] Rahul: *U probably can if it's a direct flight depending on the weight of ur kit and backpack
[8/16/17, 10:25:25 AM] Rahul: - take the kit in addn to backpack on hand
[8/16/17, 10:26:15 AM] Suyash: Yeah if you play it off coolly
[8/16/17, 10:47:30 AM] Akshay: Yup that's what I meant. This time I'm not on Emirates, going on air France
[8/16/17, 12:05:36 PM] Rahul: lol I remember that
[8/16/17, 12:05:47 PM] Rahul: Diffeeent experience in Air France
[8/16/17, 12:05:56 PM] Rahul: *different
[8/16/17, 12:06:51 PM] Rahul: The seats aren't straight - as in not parallel to each other and perpendicular to the length of the plane
[8/16/17, 12:14:06 PM] Suyash: That's probably business class üòÇ
[8/16/17, 12:40:09 PM] Akshay: Haha must be business hahahaha
[8/16/17, 8:56:04 PM] Akshay: What time are you all playing/meeting today
[8/16/17, 8:56:28 PM] Akshay: I may not be free morning. Afternoon is fine.
[8/16/17, 8:56:49 PM] Akshay: Evening/late is also probably difficult
[8/16/17, 8:59:31 PM] Sunil: How about 2-4?
[8/16/17, 9:11:17 PM] Akshay: Hmm... Will try to plan my schedule and ask my mother haha
[8/16/17, 11:23:32 PM] Suyash: I can book from 2-3 only, so maybe TT after that
[8/16/17, 11:24:06 PM] Udit: üëå

[8/17/17, 12:54:21 AM] Udit: Badminton
[8/17/17, 12:55:03 AM] Akshay: Ahh ok
[8/17/17, 12:55:19 AM] Akshay: I would also like to play some PS at suyash's house if possible

[8/29/17, 8:25:13 AM] Akshay: Not much syllabus done yet and now it's going to be all rushed after we start
[8/29/17, 8:59:15 AM] Suyash: Sunil any hurricane effects in Arlington?

[8/31/17, 9:34:32 PM] Akshay: But the flood prediction-that's totally different!
[8/31/17, 9:34:49 PM] Akshay: At least from what I know

[9/3/17, 11:00:56 AM] Suyash: Ahh üòÇ
[9/6/17, 2:12:15 AM] Suyash: Here's a brain teaser -> You have two ropes, each takes 1 hr to burn. How would you use them to time 15 minutes? The ropes can be of uneven density - so 1/2 the rope doesn't necessarily burn in 1/2 an hour...
[9/6/17, 8:50:18 PM] Akshay: He's done it. Big giant Del Potro has done it!
[9/6/17, 8:56:33 PM] Rahul: Noooooooo

[9/6/17, 8:58:47 PM] Rahul: Somehow nobody supports him üò∂
[9/6/17, 8:59:20 PM] Akshay: Many do
[9/6/17, 8:59:36 PM] Akshay: He just doesn't have the biggest fan base yet, still relatively young and new
[9/6/17, 10:20:07 PM] Suyash: Epic! Great news to wake up to :)
[9/10/17, 4:58:21 PM] Akshay: Phenomenadal

[9/13/17, 4:53:28 AM] Suyash: The link is outdated tho
[9/13/17, 4:54:18 AM] Akshay: Yup
[9/13/17, 4:55:14 AM] Akshay: This might be the defining academic/intellectual problem that our generation faces.
[9/13/17, 4:55:39 AM] Akshay: Screw global warming, poverty et al-decide which of these 3 is the best!
[9/13/17, 4:55:54 AM] Suyash: Yup üòù

[9/13/17, 4:19:15 PM] Rahul: And what's wrong with a fam group chat?
[9/13/17, 4:22:14 PM] Akshay: Well in India so many ppl use similar names for different family members
[9/13/17, 4:22:54 PM] Akshay: Some people might address their grandfather/older brother as dada , so I wasn't sure
[9/13/17, 4:23:19 PM] Akshay: Nothing wrong with a fam group chat, I have one too-it's just typical, that's all I said.

[9/14/17, 7:34:33 AM] Akshay: Every player can only beat what's in front of them
[9/14/17, 7:41:57 AM] Suyash: Hahah brilliant
[9/14/17, 7:42:54 AM] Suyash: The author is taking "This might be the defining academic/intellectual problem that our generation faces" too seriously ü§£
[9/14/17, 7:43:14 AM] Akshay: Yup
[9/14/17, 7:43:32 AM] Akshay: Are you and udit playing squash these days
[9/14/17, 7:43:47 AM] Suyash: Not any more, Udit left for uni yesterday
[9/14/17, 7:51:22 AM] Suyash: "Nadal, though a great player, is interesting primarily as a means of describing the limits of Federer's genius."
[9/14/17, 7:57:24 AM] Akshay: Ahh. Good luck for the term Udit.
[9/14/17, 7:57:33 AM] Akshay: Damn that's savage
[9/14/17, 7:57:48 AM] Suyash: Read it in the comments to that article
[9/14/17, 7:57:58 AM] Akshay: I'd argue-although neither of them is my favourite player- that Nadal's genius is probably higher than Fed
[9/14/17, 7:58:24 AM] Akshay: Because he has trumped genius without that ridiculous gift
[9/14/17, 7:58:51 AM] Suyash: He's the ultimate athlete
[9/14/17, 7:59:04 AM] Akshay: Him, Murray, Djokovic
[9/14/17, 7:59:23 AM] Akshay: Federer to me isn't the ultimate "athlete"
[9/14/17, 7:59:33 AM] Akshay: He has a slight paunch lol
[9/14/17, 7:59:40 AM] Suyash: Hahaha
[9/14/17, 7:59:51 AM] Akshay: Sort of like me :")
[9/14/17, 8:00:12 AM] Suyash: Lol are your dimensions about the same as his?
[9/14/17, 8:01:01 AM] Akshay: No I'm taller, weaker, thinner arms. Federer isn't light-I think he is at least 85 kgs
[9/14/17, 8:01:33 AM] Akshay: I remember some time back when I started getting interested in tennis, both Federer and Nadal were 185 cm and 85 kgs-yet how different they looked?
[9/14/17, 8:01:37 AM] Akshay: !*
[9/14/17, 8:02:02 AM] Suyash: Yup, that's correct. Both same height and weight
[9/14/17, 8:02:36 AM] Akshay: Yup. I have to leave to class soon.
[9/14/17, 8:02:40 AM] Akshay: Bye
[9/14/17, 8:02:50 AM] Suyash: Bye
[9/14/17, 8:02:59 AM] Udit: Yo bois reached Manchester!
[9/14/17, 8:06:07 AM] Sunil: Nice!
[9/14/17, 8:06:24 AM] Sunil: When's the semester starting for you?
[9/14/17, 12:43:04 PM] Udit: Next week
[9/15/17, 4:29:58 PM] Akshay: http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/09/trash-talk-the-bayou-bucket-returns
[9/15/17, 4:30:03 PM] Akshay: This is funny
[9/15/17, 4:30:22 PM] Akshay: On Saturday, there is a  rice vs university of Houston football game
[9/15/17, 4:30:40 PM] Akshay: The campus newspapers of both schools have come up with trash talk
[9/15/17, 4:30:54 PM] Akshay: The UH ppl did it first haha
[9/15/17, 4:31:05 PM] Akshay: The thresher trying to reply
[9/15/17, 4:31:15 PM] Akshay: Thresher is the rice paper
[9/15/17, 11:25:24 PM] Suyash: Wow üòÇ
[9/17/17, 4:31:02 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/17/17, 4:31:47 PM] Akshay: I think this picture that I took of myself, although a pose, accurately depicts the feeling of relief when the matlab code finally gives you something similar to the required output.
[9/17/17, 11:05:20 PM] Udit: Kya baat
[9/17/17, 11:05:44 PM] Udit: I mean I hv no clue what that matlab code is
[9/17/17, 11:05:55 PM] Udit: But awesome photo
[9/18/17, 4:26:46 AM] Akshay: Haha udit-I wish I had a clue what the matlab code is!
[9/18/17, 9:08:33 AM] Suyash: Hahaha Akshay - this kinda satisfaction is why ppl major in CS :")
[9/18/17, 9:12:31 AM] Akshay: Lol this kind of torture?
[9/18/17, 9:12:58 AM] Akshay: For me the satisfaction is more about finishing it than achieving it I guess
[9/18/17, 9:14:33 AM] Suyash: Yup school projects finishing is the ultimate aim - not much care for what the actual project is
[9/18/17, 9:21:11 AM] Akshay: Yup. Very little deep learning
[9/18/17, 9:21:31 AM] Akshay: Ahh that was an accidental, normal English usage of deep learning
[9/18/17, 9:21:36 AM] Akshay: Not the technical term
[9/18/17, 9:21:52 AM] Akshay: I mean, no incentive to analyse the work in-depth
[9/18/17, 9:22:10 AM] Suyash: Haha deep learning
[9/18/17, 9:23:05 AM] Suyash: It's mostly to give yourself a strong familiarity with the programming language and general problem solving ability for the future
[9/18/17, 9:23:13 AM] Akshay: Yup
[9/18/17, 9:23:41 AM] Akshay: And to use matlab functionality
[9/19/17, 9:28:57 PM] Akshay: Ffs Mexico city earthquake today
[9/19/17, 9:28:57 PM] Akshay: 140+ deax
[9/19/17, 9:28:58 PM] Akshay: Dead
[9/19/17, 10:39:32 PM] Suyash: Yup horrible
[9/19/17, 10:39:48 PM] Suyash: Another hurricane also
[9/19/17, 10:40:25 PM] Sunil: Yep it's sad
[9/19/17, 10:40:55 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/19/17, 11:17:34 PM] Suyash: Now 220+ dead
[9/20/17, 2:27:18 AM] Udit: Oh shit!
[9/20/17, 4:01:00 AM] Akshay: Gosh
[9/20/17, 4:01:17 AM] Akshay: üôèüèΩ
[9/20/17, 5:01:07 AM] Akshay: Damn, what is it saying? UAE and Saudi ?
[9/20/17, 5:04:20 AM] Akshay: As if earthquake was not enough-Hurricane Maria just destroys Puerto rico
[9/20/17, 7:37:44 AM] Suyash: KSA national day, it seems
[9/20/17, 7:55:31 AM] Akshay: Lol
[9/20/17, 6:11:33 PM] Akshay: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/20/ohio-state-university-privilege-workshop-says-only-white-people-can-be-racist.amp.html
[9/20/17, 6:11:52 PM] Akshay: No wonder rahul is so full of shit, the place makes him so !
[9/20/17, 6:11:53 PM] Akshay: :")
[9/20/17, 6:12:00 PM] Akshay: Jk mate
[9/20/17, 6:12:56 PM] Akshay: Lol the article is very confusing-are they trying to teach a good thing or a bad thing, I can't understand
[9/20/17, 6:15:33 PM] Akshay: Suyash, when do you leave to UCLA?
[9/20/17, 7:18:52 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/20/17, 7:19:04 PM] Rahul: *get back
[9/20/17, 7:24:42 PM] Akshay: Woah how did the tests go?
[9/20/17, 7:24:52 PM] Akshay: That must be painful-3 in a day!
[9/20/17, 7:26:57 PM] Rahul: That's ok yar
[9/20/17, 7:27:04 PM] Rahul: I prolly got full on all the tests
[9/20/17, 7:27:14 PM] Rahul: Chem and accounting mostly multiple choice also
[9/20/17, 7:27:34 PM] Rahul: The concentration just induces pneumonia
[9/20/17, 7:28:04 PM] Rahul: I have a super bad cold and it feels my head is really heavy
[9/20/17, 7:28:38 PM] Rahul: Because u have to work the answers for the multiple choice it's tricky
[9/20/17, 7:29:34 PM] Rahul: I had fever just before Chem exam
[9/20/17, 7:35:58 PM] Akshay: Oh dude
[9/20/17, 7:36:25 PM] Akshay: But it's good if you've done well-fever is temporary, the marks stay forever, that's the hustle needed
[9/20/17, 11:13:42 PM] Suyash: Good stuff Rahul
[9/20/17, 11:13:56 PM] Suyash: I am going back on Tuesday
[9/22/17, 9:22:06 AM] Rahul: Going back?
[9/22/17, 9:22:19 AM] Rahul: Oh yeah shit going back to cali
[9/22/17, 9:22:34 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/22/17, 9:23:42 AM] Akshay: Dude this time it's growing differently
[9/22/17, 9:24:10 AM] Rahul: It's more full
[9/22/17, 9:24:16 AM] Akshay: Exactly
[9/22/17, 9:24:18 AM] Rahul: At the bottom
[9/22/17, 9:24:23 AM] Akshay: I was trying to think of someone to compare to
[9/22/17, 9:24:32 AM] Akshay: It's like more compact
[9/22/17, 9:24:37 AM] Rahul: Any driving instructor in Dubai
[9/22/17, 9:25:00 AM] Akshay: Lol, I was thinking, Inzamam while he was playing
[9/22/17, 9:25:21 AM] Akshay: Now he has a huge beard though:")
[9/22/17, 9:25:21 AM] Rahul: Woah shit
[9/22/17, 9:25:26 AM] Akshay: But taxi driver will do
[9/22/17, 9:25:35 AM] Akshay: Or driving instructor lol
[9/22/17, 9:26:01 AM] Rahul: Dude I loved inzamam
[9/22/17, 9:26:18 AM] Akshay: He used to crush Indian bowling
[9/22/17, 9:26:35 AM] Rahul: I still remember watching the TV the first time I saw someone hit out of the stadium
[9/22/17, 9:26:49 AM] Akshay: Woah was it inzy?
[9/22/17, 9:26:56 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[9/22/17, 9:27:20 AM] Rahul: Think way back in 2nd grade or something
[9/22/17, 9:28:19 AM] Rahul: For some reason I also remember that day in the evening I was coming back from karate class in the van and I saw you in Karan's
[9/22/17, 9:28:23 AM] Rahul: *karama
[9/22/17, 9:28:34 AM] Rahul: With your mom and grandad
[9/22/17, 9:28:34 AM] Akshay: Woah ok. Very random memories.
[9/22/17, 9:28:39 AM] Akshay: Woah lol
[9/22/17, 9:28:43 AM] Rahul: Who I thought was your dad
[9/22/17, 9:28:59 AM] Akshay: Instead of this, if you remembered a few physics formulae... At school I mean.
[9/22/17, 9:29:05 AM] Akshay: :")
[9/22/17, 9:29:25 AM] Rahul: Baba u started studying physics in second grade only ü§£
[9/22/17, 9:29:34 AM] Akshay: But tbh life memories are quite useful
[9/22/17, 9:30:01 AM] Akshay: Academic info seems pretty limited in scope-learn, write exam, finish term, forget
[9/22/17, 9:30:13 AM] Akshay: I think it's the way academics is taught
[9/22/17, 9:30:40 AM] Rahul: Okay, Akshay monologue, Rahul exits
[9/22/17, 9:30:45 AM] Akshay: Is not conducive to retention, unless we repeat a lot, which is also wasteful
[9/22/17, 9:30:56 AM] Akshay: Bye
[9/22/17, 9:37:25 AM] Rahul: *can you italicize using the standard typing ont the phone - 'exits' should have been italicized
[9/22/17, 10:11:58 AM] Rahul: Woah just thought I'd google India recent cricket, did u guys see Hardik pandya caught and run out on a no ball but not out
[9/22/17, 10:12:15 AM] Rahul: Everything on the same ball
[9/22/17, 10:12:35 AM] Rahul: Some rule about the batsman thinking he is out and walking off by mistake
[9/22/17, 10:20:55 AM] Akshay: Lol damn
[9/22/17, 11:01:52 AM] Suyash: You can _italicise_ using _
[9/22/17, 11:15:02 AM] Rahul: _Ah_ _I see_
[9/22/17, 11:17:25 AM] Rahul: *i didn't know u cud do this too*
[9/22/17, 11:18:34 AM] Suyash: Yup
[9/23/17, 7:05:00 AM] Rahul: Hehe just notices the Ohio state thing you posted üëÜüèΩ
[9/23/17, 7:05:08 AM] Rahul: *noticed
[9/23/17, 7:05:23 AM] Rahul: Me, full of shit?!üò≥
[9/23/17, 7:06:51 AM] Rahul: I don't take that as a joke. I'm surprised the person saying that took a Fox News articles' word for it
[9/23/17, 7:07:51 AM] Rahul: In case you don't know the context, Fox News is super conservative
[9/23/17, 7:08:36 AM] Rahul: A liberal newspaper would have glorified the same lecture/ session/ whatever it is
[9/23/17, 7:14:10 AM] Akshay: üôèüèΩ maaf kar do bhaai
[9/23/17, 7:14:24 AM] Akshay: I don't know all that
[9/23/17, 7:14:26 AM] Rahul: I can't take a joke
[9/23/17, 7:14:42 AM] Akshay: Saw something weird about ohio state-decided it was the perfect opportunity to rile you
[9/23/17, 7:14:43 AM] Rahul: I'm Sunil senior
[9/23/17, 7:14:52 AM] Rahul: Lol man chill I'm kidding too
[9/23/17, 7:14:57 AM] Rahul: It's all cool
[9/23/17, 7:15:04 AM] Akshay: :")
[9/23/17, 7:15:19 AM] Akshay: It's still not as bad a crime as touching Sunil's neck
[9/23/17, 7:15:32 AM] Rahul: Lol Sunil where are you
[9/23/17, 7:15:53 AM] Rahul: Dude we have to wait till December to find out if Sunil is alive
[9/23/17, 7:16:08 AM] Akshay: He is alive
[9/23/17, 7:16:10 AM] Sunil: Haha
[9/23/17, 7:16:32 AM] Rahul: What's up man
[9/23/17, 7:16:38 AM] Rahul: Long time no whatsapp
[9/23/17, 7:16:58 AM] Sunil: Yep long time
[9/23/17, 7:17:18 AM] Sunil: Nm man, I've been quite busy this week that's all
[9/23/17, 7:17:33 AM] Rahul: Ahh ok
[9/23/17, 7:18:10 AM] Rahul: Ive been quite busy too
[9/23/17, 7:18:32 AM] Rahul: What are you guys doing in uni
[9/23/17, 7:20:23 AM] Sunil: Same old
[9/23/17, 7:21:19 AM] Sunil: Studies and table tennis
[9/23/17, 7:40:02 AM] Akshay: Same old. Crying and tennis.
[9/23/17, 8:09:40 AM] Rahul: Lol
[9/23/17, 8:09:50 AM] Rahul: Where Suyash and Udit?
[9/23/17, 10:15:05 AM] Suyash: üòÇ
[9/23/17, 10:15:39 AM] Suyash: I'm chilling at home still, leaving on Tuesday
[9/23/17, 10:16:24 AM] Rahul: Lucky
[9/23/17, 10:18:06 AM] Rahul: I miss Dubai man
[9/23/17, 10:18:36 AM] Suyash: Lazy lifestyle here
[9/23/17, 10:18:44 AM] Rahul: But when I was in Dubai I kinda missed Columbus too
[9/23/17, 10:18:49 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[9/23/17, 10:18:56 AM] Suyash: At this point, I have absolutely nothing to do here
[9/23/17, 10:20:39 AM] Suyash: If the alternative is studying, prefer Dubai. If the alternative is a lazy, oft-boring lifestyle, prefer US.
[9/23/17, 10:30:39 AM] Akshay: Lol from the frying pan (uni academia) unto the fire (dubai weather)
[9/23/17, 12:33:41 PM] Suyash: Another quake in Mexico...
[9/23/17, 12:40:38 PM] Akshay: Yes I saw
[9/23/17, 12:42:32 PM] Suyash: #FedalUtd
[9/23/17, 12:43:24 PM] Akshay: Has it begun?
[9/23/17, 12:43:37 PM] Akshay: Ffs I have to go to office hrs of the TA for help with my matlab project
[9/23/17, 12:43:38 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[9/23/17, 12:43:57 PM] Akshay: Academics this semester is really gruelling, even though I'm in only 16 hrs compared to 18 last yr
[9/23/17, 12:44:04 PM] Akshay: Every assignment takes extra time
[9/23/17, 12:44:06 PM] Suyash: Yup pretty entertaining
[9/23/17, 12:44:08 PM] Suyash: Damn
[9/23/17, 12:44:42 PM] Suyash: It is almost like a movie, you can listen to them discuss strategy in the changeover etc
[9/23/17, 12:44:43 PM] Akshay: Well, if you say so, my project work can F off...
[9/23/17, 12:44:47 PM] Akshay: Woah
[9/23/17, 12:44:56 PM] Akshay: To hell with the TA
[9/23/17, 12:45:15 PM] Suyash: There is a live stream on the laver cup website itself
[9/23/17, 12:45:19 PM] Suyash: Haha yup
[9/23/17, 12:47:23 PM] Suyash: A funny point where both go for the smash, almost jam into each other - Fed has to duck out and Nadal takes it
[9/23/17, 12:52:28 PM] Akshay: I'm watching now
[9/23/17, 12:54:38 PM] Suyash: I very rarely go to office hours, ~ 3-4 times the entire year
[9/23/17, 12:55:15 PM] Suyash: Parents would be pissed if they knew :")
[9/23/17, 12:55:25 PM] Akshay: Just heard Nadal ask Berdych to pass him some scissors
[9/23/17, 12:55:32 PM] Akshay: Federer adds "sharp ones"
[9/23/17, 12:55:52 PM] Suyash: Yup lol üòÇ
[9/23/17, 12:56:24 PM] Suyash: Berdych will make sure they're sharp :")
[9/23/17, 12:56:29 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[9/23/17, 12:56:46 PM] Akshay: Haha
[9/23/17, 12:56:51 PM] Akshay: Dude you got thin
[9/23/17, 12:57:08 PM] Akshay: Your shadow is on the screen
[9/23/17, 12:57:38 PM] Rahul: Haha not all of me
[9/23/17, 1:02:57 PM] Akshay: üòÇ
[9/23/17, 1:07:10 PM] Akshay: Epic rally, Federer got pegged lol
[9/23/17, 1:08:04 PM] Suyash: Yeah hahah
[9/23/17, 1:08:52 PM] Suyash: My mind keeps fixating on someone getting a knock during the serve :")
[9/26/17, 7:09:45 PM] Akshay: I'm going to Arlington on Saturday
[9/26/17, 7:09:48 PM] Akshay: Club tennis tournament
[9/26/17, 7:10:01 PM] Akshay: But Sunil I don't yet know if we are playing at UT or somewhere else
[9/26/17, 7:10:09 PM] Akshay: I'll let you know
[9/26/17, 7:10:12 PM] Akshay: Maybe meet up?
[9/26/17, 7:40:39 PM] Sunil: Oh wow
[9/26/17, 7:40:47 PM] Sunil: Sure man, lmk once you're here
[9/26/17, 7:49:33 PM] Akshay: Cool

[9/26/17, 10:17:53 PM] Akshay: How's uni looking mate? Welcome to the native land.
[9/26/17, 10:50:46 PM] Suyash: Right now entire campus is chilling
[9/26/17, 10:51:05 PM] Suyash: Missing the ultimate comforts of Dubai
[9/26/17, 10:51:34 PM] Akshay: You'll be back home very quick
[9/26/17, 10:51:51 PM] Akshay: You aren't 5 weeks in and regretting your life like we may be :")
[9/26/17, 11:04:36 PM] Suyash: Lol
[9/28/17, 8:19:35 AM] Udit: Lol
[9/30/17, 10:29:01 AM] Rahul: Fatal break approaching fellows
[9/30/17, 10:29:09 AM] Rahul: Less than 2 weeks to go
[9/30/17, 10:43:50 AM] Suyash: lol what's ^ about?
[9/30/17, 11:41:36 AM] Rahul: *Fall break üòÇ
[9/30/17, 11:50:07 AM] Suyash: Haha how long is the break?
[9/30/17, 12:06:46 PM] Rahul: 4 days
[9/30/17, 12:06:54 PM] Rahul: Including the weekend
[10/2/17, 6:33:16 PM] Akshay: That guy in Las Vegas is just the pits of humanity
[10/2/17, 6:33:25 PM] Akshay: He's not even human
[10/2/17, 7:07:30 PM] Sunil: Yep very sad indeed
[10/5/17, 6:25:41 AM] Akshay: Forgot to tell you
[10/5/17, 6:25:47 AM] Akshay: We are shifting house in Dubai
[10/5/17, 6:25:56 AM] Akshay: To a building in Oud metha
[10/5/17, 6:26:26 AM] Akshay: It's smaller. 2 bedroom.
[10/5/17, 6:27:07 AM] Sunil: Oh wow
[10/5/17, 6:28:03 AM] Sunil: Is it next to the metro station?
[10/5/17, 6:28:30 AM] Akshay: It's nearby but quite a walk
[10/5/17, 6:28:33 AM] Akshay: Not too close
[10/5/17, 7:01:23 AM] Rahul: No more dining table üèì
[10/5/17, 7:01:27 AM] Rahul: ?
[10/5/17, 7:03:25 AM] Rahul: I think your home is _slightly_ closer to mine now
[10/5/17, 7:03:39 AM] Sunil: Lol
[10/5/17, 7:05:50 AM] Akshay: Lol we will still have a dining table, but whether it will be as big/the same table is a doubt
[10/5/17, 7:06:24 AM] Akshay: Lol the house is a glorified one bedroom. It has a small maid's bedroom that probably becomes mine :")
[10/5/17, 8:52:14 AM] Rahul: And your sister?
[10/5/17, 8:52:18 AM] Rahul: Homeless?
[10/5/17, 8:53:31 AM] Rahul: Woah shit that came out so wrong sorry

[10/5/17, 9:55:35 AM] Udit: Kya baat hai
[10/5/17, 9:56:42 AM] Rahul: Finally in the easiest shitiest question they tell you to find the minimum distance between the plane and the point (prolly just for shits and gigs) after all the calculus parts of the question are done
[10/5/17, 9:56:49 AM] Rahul: And you make a mistake in that
[10/5/17, 10:17:56 AM] Akshay: Lol 99 is epic
[10/5/17, 10:19:15 AM] Akshay: No one will be homeless lol

[10/11/17, 5:54:33 AM] Sunil: Lucky you guys
[10/11/17, 5:55:25 AM] Sunil: My college doesn't have this fall break concept
[10/11/17, 6:26:56 AM] Akshay: Yup. They want you to study.
[10/11/17, 6:27:27 AM] Akshay: It doesn't matter too much though-I got extra hw this week because teachers said "anyway you have more time to do it"

[10/12/17, 1:43:24 PM] Sunil: Yep it's insane
[10/12/17, 1:43:36 PM] Sunil: Didn't expect it to be tbh
[10/12/17, 1:47:36 PM] Suyash: yeah
[10/13/17, 9:28:58 AM] Akshay: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/12/oops-rick-perry-flubs-and-calls-puerto-rico-a-country/
[10/13/17, 9:29:00 AM] Akshay: Brilliant
[10/13/17, 9:29:13 AM] Akshay: He clearly is the most ingenious mind of our times.
[10/13/17, 9:34:08 AM] Akshay: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[10/13/17, 9:34:08 AM] Akshay: This one is pretty good too
[10/14/17, 10:04:18 AM] Suyash: Fedal again
[10/14/17, 10:05:13 AM] Suyash: Lol I thought the comedian was North East Indian

[10/14/17, 11:09:58 AM] Akshay: Final in Shanghai. Tomorrow
[10/14/17, 11:15:20 AM] Suyash: Yup early morning
[10/15/17, 5:37:24 PM] Akshay: How's the semester going
[10/15/17, 5:37:51 PM] Akshay: I'm dying right now. Too much hw. Exams every week etc. Still 2 months before I can go home üòµ
[10/15/17, 5:38:14 PM] Akshay: I expect it's roughly the same for all of you, although udit can atleast go home
[10/15/17, 6:23:19 PM] Suyash: Damn
[10/15/17, 6:23:23 PM] Sunil: Same here Akshay
[10/15/17, 6:23:36 PM] Sunil: For me it's bc of long lab reports every week
[10/15/17, 6:24:10 PM] Sunil: And a strict TA who expects perfection in the reports
[10/15/17, 6:24:31 PM] Suyash: My course work has been alright till now - midterm next week
[10/15/17, 6:24:46 PM] Suyash: Have to take writing - just finished a totally BS paper
[10/15/17, 6:24:55 PM] Suyash: More importantly, this week is career fair
[10/15/17, 6:25:53 PM] Akshay: Ahh good luck
[10/15/17, 6:26:25 PM] Akshay: Yeah Sunil I understand that in a way. I have matlab this semester. Projects basically every week. It's frustrating also because I don't exactly understand how it is useful in any way
[10/15/17, 6:27:10 PM] Sunil: I like how matlab is supposed to be easy
[10/15/17, 6:27:28 PM] Akshay: Technically, it is
[10/15/17, 6:27:28 PM] Sunil: But honestly I prefer C programming
[10/15/17, 6:27:39 PM] Suyash: Lol
[10/15/17, 6:27:38 PM] Akshay: Because it has inbuilt commands for everything
[10/15/17, 6:27:51 PM] Akshay: But because the stupid course wants to teach you logic
[10/15/17, 6:28:07 PM] Akshay: They make you write codes to achieve what you can actually get in one line with matlab
[10/15/17, 6:28:22 PM] Sunil: True
[10/17/17, 7:32:47 PM] Akshay: Happy Diwali lads
[10/17/17, 7:48:16 PM] Rahul: Isn‚Äôt that on Thursday?
[10/17/17, 9:05:48 PM] Udit: Ya I think it is on Thursday
[10/17/17, 9:09:41 PM] Akshay: Ok. My parents said it is today-Wednesday in Dubai/India etc
[10/17/17, 9:09:54 PM] Akshay: I think the difference is that south indians celebrate a day earlier
[10/17/17, 9:10:08 PM] Udit: I think it is 'choti Diwali today
[10/17/17, 9:10:48 PM] Akshay: Lol there's no choti or badi in Deepavali :") but I know that your family would celebrate Thursday, 19th
[10/17/17, 9:30:35 PM] Udit: Haha my guess is choti and badi Diwali were just an excuse for people to burst more crackers üòÇüòõ
[10/17/17, 9:36:07 PM] Akshay: Definitely!
[10/17/17, 9:37:00 PM] Udit: But still miss bursting crackers in that parking lot
[10/17/17, 9:37:09 PM] Udit: Haha
[10/17/17, 9:37:10 PM] Akshay: Lolol
[10/18/17, 11:01:05 AM] Suyash: Lol my parents have asked me to join the Pooja through Skype
[10/18/17, 11:15:39 AM] Akshay: Ha enjoy it
[10/20/17, 7:55:16 PM] Suyash: Met this dude today from South Africa
[10/20/17, 7:55:28 PM] Suyash: He is Elon Musk's first cousin
[10/20/17, 7:55:35 PM] Akshay: Ahh
[10/20/17, 7:55:45 PM] Suyash: Insane
[10/20/17, 7:56:08 PM] Akshay: I knew there had to be something important. Otherwise you wouldn't just describe your meeting with a south African
[10/20/17, 7:56:21 PM] Akshay: Lol. This is called achievement by association
[10/20/17, 7:56:47 PM] Akshay: Like my friend does something epic and everyone knows me well because I'm his friendüòÇ
[10/20/17, 7:58:01 PM] Suyash: Lol
[10/20/17, 7:58:16 PM] Suyash: Probably won't see that guy again
[10/20/17, 7:58:21 PM] Akshay: Is he at ucla

[10/20/17, 7:58:42 PM] Akshay: An undergraduate?
[10/20/17, 7:58:44 PM] Suyash: It was part of a recruiting chat for a club - lol the question was what's one time you failed... His first reply was not getting into Stan CS :")

[10/31/17, 2:51:07 PM] Akshay: Ffs what's happening
[10/31/17, 2:51:34 PM] Akshay: And yet, ppl insist that the world is safer than it has ever been! Which is true I think
[10/31/17, 8:43:15 PM] Akshay: Suyash our friendship is at stake with this intense baseball series, houston and LA
[10/31/17, 8:45:33 PM] Akshay: Ffs Houston lost

[10/31/17, 8:49:09 PM] Akshay: The roof will blow off
[10/31/17, 8:49:31 PM] Akshay: There's like  one guy from LA who is wildly happy
[11/1/17, 11:25:32 AM] Suyash: Haha
[11/1/17, 11:26:09 AM] Suyash: Baseball I feel is not so physically tasking - it's slow
[11/1/17, 11:26:30 AM] Suyash: Which is why they have back to back games
[11/1/17, 11:57:03 AM] Akshay: Yes. It's less athletic than cricket lol
[11/1/17, 11:57:53 AM] Akshay: It seems only the bowlers can't play consecutive days because their shoulder takes a huge burden
[11/1/17, 11:57:58 AM] Akshay: Pitchers*

[11/2/17, 3:49:53 PM] Akshay: The exams are still weird though right
[11/2/17, 3:50:12 PM] Rahul: Ours are 30 questions in 1hr 15 mins

[11/8/17, 8:29:44 PM] Akshay: 2017 maybe one of the least engaging, but still entertaining
[11/8/17, 8:30:05 PM] Akshay: I just wasn't personally engaged, most tournaments I didn't care who really won
[11/8/17, 8:30:33 PM] Akshay: Hope he comes back to top shape in Jan. His form will decide how my semester's motivation keeps up lol.
[11/10/17, 7:08:42 PM] Rahul: <‚Äévideo omitted>

[11/10/17, 7:14:22 PM] Rahul: It‚Äôs too funny
[11/10/17, 7:15:22 PM] Rahul: Have you seen the one In Which there is a lady learning how to ride a motorbike and she hits a car and her shoe flies off
[11/10/17, 7:15:39 PM] Rahul: That one takes the cake, pie and everything else
[11/10/17, 7:15:54 PM] Suyash: Woah I haven't seen that
[11/10/17, 7:16:00 PM] Suyash: Share it if possible :")

[11/10/17, 7:29:25 PM] Akshay: He plays on the D1 tennis team
[11/10/17, 7:29:29 PM] Akshay: It was insanity
[11/10/17, 7:29:46 PM] Akshay: I had to scramble like hell just for an ordinary rally lol
[11/10/17, 7:30:03 PM] Akshay: He's played against Francis tiafoe/Taylor Fritz et al
[11/10/17, 7:30:14 PM] Akshay: Was number 11 in US juniors lol
[11/10/17, 7:30:17 PM] Akshay: Insanity
[11/10/17, 7:30:23 PM] Akshay: The ball striking was so pure
[11/10/17, 7:31:43 PM] Suyash: Woah
[11/10/17, 7:32:10 PM] Suyash: You're now 2 degrees of separation away from Federer!
[11/10/17, 7:32:42 PM] Suyash: What a ledge
[11/10/17, 7:32:46 PM] Suyash: *Rutledge

[11/10/17, 7:52:39 PM] Akshay: Why?
[11/10/17, 7:54:26 PM] Suyash: Veterans Day
[11/10/17, 8:37:57 PM] Rahul: Yes
[11/13/17, 1:15:14 PM] Suyash: Ffs Nadal losing
[11/13/17, 2:01:52 PM] Suyash: Insane defends 4 match points
[11/13/17, 2:01:58 PM] Suyash: Italy out of the WC
[11/13/17, 3:24:36 PM] Akshay: Yes! Goffin!
[11/13/17, 3:24:38 PM] Akshay: Allez!
[11/13/17, 3:37:21 PM] Suyash: Nadal pulls out damn
[11/14/17, 8:29:46 AM] Rahul: Bombed my second statics midterm lol
[11/14/17, 8:31:30 AM] Rahul: 26/30
[11/14/17, 8:31:40 AM] Akshay: That's pretty good
[11/14/17, 8:31:41 AM] Rahul: First bombed exam this semester
[11/14/17, 8:32:04 AM] Rahul: It looks good in the context of 30 but it‚Äôs less than 90 percent
[11/14/17, 8:32:14 AM] Akshay: Statics is hard dude
[11/14/17, 8:32:15 AM] Rahul: I need to do well on the final now to get an A
[11/14/17, 8:32:20 AM] Akshay: Idk at OS but in general
[11/14/17, 8:47:47 AM] Sunil: Rahul that's still pretty good lol
[11/14/17, 8:57:34 AM] Rahul: Haha I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs as hard as anywhere. It‚Äôs still the first ‚ÄòME‚Äô titled course so I want to start of with an A
[11/14/17, 10:15:05 AM] Sunil: Oh okay makes sense
[11/14/17, 10:15:23 AM] Sunil: I'm taking two Me classes this semester
[11/14/17, 10:15:30 AM] Sunil: Statics and measurement
[11/14/17, 10:15:47 AM] Suyash: Fed vs Zverev today!
[11/14/17, 10:16:41 AM] Suyash: I thought I aced Math MT. Got rekt after botching up integration formulas. Ffs in diff eq they test more of calc 1
[11/14/17, 10:23:53 AM] Udit: Well I don't know if it's a good thing that my exams are after the winter break
[11/14/17, 10:35:57 AM] Akshay: It's not
[11/14/17, 10:36:04 AM] Akshay: You'll play squash with us and then mess up
[11/14/17, 10:36:21 AM] Akshay: Lol my bldg has a squash court too :") it's just too far for most of you maybe
[11/14/17, 10:36:34 AM] Akshay: Especially udit/suyash probably
[11/14/17, 10:36:50 AM] Akshay: Sunil is sort of midway between everything and yet too far cause of no metro
[11/14/17, 10:37:14 AM] Sunil: Yep exactly
[11/14/17, 10:42:08 AM] Suyash: Where is your building exactly?
[11/14/17, 10:39:15 AM] Akshay: Lol I'll be a bit away from metro too I think.
[11/14/17, 10:39:18 AM] Akshay: Not too close
[11/14/17, 10:39:20 AM] Akshay: Ffs
[11/14/17, 10:42:47 AM] Akshay: One sec
[11/14/17, 10:43:05 AM] Udit: Dude I drive now
[11/14/17, 10:43:21 AM] Udit: So no worries
[11/14/17, 10:43:37 AM] Udit: We can plan a road trip
[11/14/17, 10:43:43 AM] Suyash: You should pick and drop us all off if that is the case
[11/14/17, 10:43:49 AM] Suyash: :")
[11/14/17, 10:44:00 AM] Suyash: Cycling 50km
[11/14/17, 10:44:00 AM] Udit: Lol sure man
[11/14/17, 10:44:14 AM] Udit: Dude I am up for that as well
[11/14/17, 10:44:34 AM] Suyash: Good weather finally
[11/14/17, 10:44:51 AM] Udit: Yup
[11/14/17, 10:46:22 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[11/14/17, 10:47:08 AM] Suyash: Ah it's near Al Nasr
[11/14/17, 10:47:36 AM] Suyash: 10-15 minute walk from Metro
[11/14/17, 10:48:14 AM] Udit: Ya and 10 min drive from my place
[11/14/17, 12:07:06 PM] Rahul: Udit are you getting your own car?
[11/14/17, 12:07:32 PM] Rahul: And can you drive in U.K. ?
[11/14/17, 12:07:44 PM] Udit: Ya
[11/14/17, 12:08:02 PM] Udit: And I hv my dad's car
[11/14/17, 12:08:15 PM] Rahul: Ahh sweet
[11/14/17, 12:08:46 PM] Udit: I mean I got an international license
[11/14/17, 12:09:18 PM] Rahul: From Dubai?
[11/14/17, 12:09:39 PM] Udit: Ya
[11/14/17, 12:09:51 PM] Rahul: Sweet dude
[11/14/17, 12:10:34 PM] Udit: That's what we shld go on a road trip smwhere üòÇ
[11/14/17, 12:12:22 PM] Rahul: Dubai to India by road
[11/14/17, 12:12:26 PM] Rahul: Lol
[11/14/17, 12:12:46 PM] Rahul: That‚Äôs asking for trouble
[11/14/17, 12:14:31 PM] Rahul: I think if you could pass through Kuwait and not be in Iraq for much that would be sweet
[11/14/17, 12:15:05 PM] Akshay: Lol through saudi, iraq, iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, through Kashmir lol, and finally to maybe Delhi
[11/14/17, 12:16:53 PM] Rahul: Could go up north through Iran and pass through Tajikistan, China, Nepal and get into UP or something
[11/14/17, 12:17:24 PM] Akshay: Lol to get to Iran you have to go through saudi right
[11/14/17, 12:17:47 PM] Udit: Wtf?! üòÇ
[11/14/17, 12:17:49 PM] Rahul: Yeah but Saudi isn‚Äôt too bad
[11/14/17, 12:17:55 PM] Udit: I was thinking smthing local
[11/14/17, 12:18:04 PM] Udit: Like bur  Dubai to katana
[11/14/17, 12:18:08 PM] Akshay: Nah you are small scale
[11/14/17, 12:18:07 PM] Udit: Karama
[11/14/17, 12:18:13 PM] Udit: Haha
[11/14/17, 12:18:27 PM] Rahul: I‚Äôd be more afraid of the Kuwait Iraq border
[11/14/17, 12:19:20 PM] Rahul: I meant we could avoid Afghanistan, Pakistan and J&K
[11/14/17, 12:20:08 PM] Udit: I am quite sure going by plane would be much cheaper
[11/14/17, 12:20:37 PM] Suyash: I think we'll need to ferry across the Gulf
[11/14/17, 12:20:41 PM] Suyash: With the car
[11/14/17, 12:22:13 PM] Akshay: Chill. I think squash is better
[11/14/17, 12:22:43 PM] Akshay: Knowing Sunil, he will cry intensely about having to "walk in the hot sun" from his house to Udit's
[11/14/17, 12:22:57 PM] Akshay: Forget a Dubai to india road trip lol
[11/14/17, 1:09:35 PM] Suyash: Fed always lucky, makes it out
[11/14/17, 1:14:36 PM] Akshay: Yup
[11/14/17, 1:34:44 PM] Suyash: Woah I stopped watching
[11/14/17, 1:34:47 PM] Suyash: Zverev broke back
[11/14/17, 1:55:38 PM] Suyash: 1-1 yess
[11/14/17, 2:26:16 PM] Rahul: Yes fed won
[11/15/17, 12:20:08 PM] Suyash: Woah how did Dimitrov thrash Goffin
[11/15/17, 12:40:29 PM] Akshay: I read goffin is slightly injured too
[11/15/17, 12:40:36 PM] Akshay: But dimi way too good anyway today
[11/15/17, 12:58:23 PM] Suyash: Federer is pretty much set to win
[11/15/17, 12:58:47 PM] Suyash: Need a legend like Delpo to break through him
[11/15/17, 7:34:53 PM] Akshay: Nah lol, hate to admit it but now more than ever, stopping a Federer riot requires a hero, he who must not be named
[11/15/17, 7:35:12 PM] Akshay: Novak Djokovic!
[11/15/17, 7:35:24 PM] Akshay: Ofc he's now a fallen hero lol
[11/16/17, 9:23:03 AM] Suyash: Definitely
[11/16/17, 9:23:38 AM] Suyash: If Djoko can mount a comeback, win 3 slams next year. He'll be in stronger contention for GOAT
[11/16/17, 10:06:18 AM] Akshay: Don't forget my man Murray. His persistence is second to none
[11/16/17, 10:09:00 AM] Sunil: Lol what contention for GOAT ?? üòÇ
[11/16/17, 10:09:12 AM] Sunil: Federer is easily the GOAT
[11/16/17, 10:12:02 AM] Suyash: http://www.tennisworldusa.org/amp_tennis/news/Roger_Federer/49071/andre-agassi-roger-federer-can-t-be-considered-the-goat-/
[11/16/17, 10:14:37 AM] Sunil: Man just bc one tennis player has his opinion against what is more or less a fact, does not add much to this argument imo
[11/16/17, 10:15:03 AM] Suyash: Agree, this is just Agassi's argument
[11/16/17, 10:15:17 AM] Suyash: But he raises a valid point
[11/16/17, 10:15:30 AM] Sunil: True
[11/16/17, 10:41:01 AM] Akshay: I doubt Nadal is goat either though
[11/16/17, 10:41:27 AM] Akshay: Of all the top players none of them have had one surface support their game as strongly as clay supports nadal
[11/16/17, 10:41:42 AM] Akshay: I mean just imagine if the tennis calendar had equal number of clay and grass tournaments
[11/16/17, 10:41:46 AM] Akshay: The clay season is long
[11/16/17, 10:42:11 AM] Akshay: Grass court season is like 5 tournaments-some of them in the same week such that Fed can only play in one at a time
[11/16/17, 10:42:26 AM] Akshay: Would Nadal have as many titles then?
[11/16/17, 10:42:32 AM] Akshay: Maybe not, we dont know
[11/16/17, 10:42:42 AM] Akshay: But the reverse is true as well
[11/16/17, 10:42:54 AM] Akshay: GOAT has to be 'unmatched', doubtless
[11/16/17, 10:43:09 AM] Akshay: If Fed has been dominated by Nadal, how can he be the GOAT?
[11/16/17, 10:45:08 AM] Akshay: And if statistics is to be considered
[11/16/17, 10:45:27 AM] Akshay: There is no one on the planet that can claim to be equal to Djokovic. Tbh. Numbers cannot lie.
[11/16/17, 1:56:02 PM] Suyash: Yup definitely
[11/16/17, 1:56:13 PM] Suyash: Zverev in trouble against Sock woah
[11/16/17, 2:03:08 PM] Suyash: Sock has totally stepped up
[11/16/17, 2:08:12 PM] Suyash: FFS Zverev choker
[11/17/17, 10:35:03 AM] Rahul: Dam yes I have nothing to do now

[11/17/17, 10:41:18 AM] Rahul: No not American, just trying to get a waft of the culture, in case I‚Äôm only here for 3 more years
[11/17/17, 10:41:36 AM] Akshay: A waft lol
[11/17/17, 10:41:39 AM] Suyash: What case is that?
[11/17/17, 10:42:07 AM] Akshay: The case that he gets kicked out due to mech e joblessness
[11/17/17, 10:42:14 AM] Rahul: Case here I go back to work in Dubai/ India/ somewhere else
[11/17/17, 10:42:27 AM] Rahul: Haha I‚Äôm trying to become a consultant lol
[11/17/17, 10:42:39 AM] Rahul: It‚Äôs the goal after IBE
[11/17/17, 10:42:55 AM] Suyash: Yup
[11/17/17, 10:43:04 AM] Suyash: Did you see the new Tesla Roadster
[11/17/17, 10:43:05 AM] Suyash: Insane
[11/17/17, 10:43:18 AM] Rahul: Maybe I‚Äôll try to do something engineering for a year or two before grad school but consultant is the goal
[11/17/17, 10:43:22 AM] Rahul: No haven‚Äôt seen yet
[11/17/17, 10:43:26 AM] Rahul: Lemme check it out
[11/17/17, 10:43:29 AM] Akshay: Ok
[11/17/17, 10:43:37 AM] Akshay: I'm trying to become an Australian open champion
[11/17/17, 10:43:56 AM] Akshay: Maybe do engineering for a year or two , but Australian open champion is the goal.
[11/17/17, 10:44:16 AM] Rahul: Good luck
[11/17/17, 10:44:18 AM] Suyash: Hahaha
[11/17/17, 10:44:27 AM] Akshay: Thanks lol
[11/17/17, 10:44:43 AM] Suyash: Why AO tho?
[11/17/17, 10:45:42 AM] Rahul: Yeah I was exp vying Wimbledon
[11/17/17, 10:45:51 AM] Rahul: *expecting
[11/17/17, 10:47:08 AM] Akshay: Lol I'll try to do that too
[11/17/17, 4:28:35 PM] Rahul: @971566932362 roadster is insane
[11/17/17, 4:28:43 PM] Rahul: Only $200K
[11/17/17, 4:31:25 PM] Rahul: I think it‚Äôs bad strategy though. May be very visionary, long term strategy to price so cheap compared to other supercars - wants to wipe out all petrol based cars and prolly have a monopoly over the electric car market - but I think in the short run he needs to take care of his balance sheet too
[11/17/17, 4:32:00 PM] Rahul: Right now Tesla stock is only valued at its current price due to public opinion
[11/17/17, 4:33:04 PM] Rahul: Whatever though, if he succeeds, our children will do it as their first case study in collegeüòÉ
[11/17/17, 4:35:19 PM] Udit: Isn't it releasing in 2020
[11/17/17, 4:35:21 PM] Rahul: Because honestly thinking about it, right now, not many people who want a supercar will buy Tesla and the ones who do want an electric supercar, will pay more for it
[11/17/17, 4:35:48 PM] Rahul: Inelastic demand
[11/17/17, 4:35:54 PM] Rahul: Lol I‚Äôm getting too nerdy
[11/17/17, 4:36:10 PM] Udit: No it makes sense
[11/17/17, 4:36:26 PM] Rahul: The truck was 2019
[11/17/17, 4:36:30 PM] Udit: But people if upper middle class will prefer it
[11/17/17, 4:36:39 PM] Udit: That looks dope
[11/17/17, 4:36:58 PM] Rahul: I‚Äôm not sure when roadster haven‚Äôt seen a date anywhere yet
[11/17/17, 4:37:33 PM] Rahul: Yeah that‚Äôs the bet he‚Äôs taking, but I‚Äôm thinking how many upper middle class would but a Tesla instead of just buying a BMW or something
[11/17/17, 4:37:52 PM] Rahul: Outside California, I‚Äôd bet against it
[11/17/17, 4:38:32 PM] Udit: True seen loads if i3 in UK as well
[11/17/17, 4:39:19 PM] Rahul: Yeah
[11/17/17, 4:40:04 PM] Rahul: And atleast as of now, many places that aren‚Äôt AS high tech which are actually cash rich still depend heavily on petroleum
[11/17/17, 4:40:55 PM] Rahul: Dubai for example, even the higher end suburbs in central and east US
[11/17/17, 5:00:25 PM] Akshay: Calm down rahul... Too nerdy
[11/17/17, 5:36:27 PM] Suyash: Lol IBE over-analysis
[11/17/17, 5:40:02 PM] Akshay: Ffs lol
[11/17/17, 6:28:03 PM] Rahul: Yeah I went overboard
[11/17/17, 6:46:18 PM] Akshay: Rest of you any plans for thanksgiving?
[11/17/17, 7:10:04 PM] Suyash: Nothing much planned for me
[11/17/17, 7:22:50 PM] Akshay: Same. Have stat exam on Tuesday after it
[11/17/17, 7:22:54 PM] Akshay: Will catch up sleep

[11/18/17, 9:21:16 AM] Udit: Great Win, after 17 Years a Miss World from India !!üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
[11/18/17, 10:33:59 AM] Akshay: When you'll have some slightly easier days or weeks with less stuff to do, less hw etc, do you start getting suspicious that you are forgetting somethingüòÇ
[11/18/17, 11:02:25 AM] Sunil: Lol that's exactly how I feel today üòÇ
[11/18/17, 11:02:51 AM] Sunil: But it doesn't happen that often bc most days these days are pretty hectic
[11/18/17, 11:11:38 AM] Akshay: Yes true. It's because it's rare that it feels weird
[11/18/17, 11:11:56 AM] Akshay: All semester I was hoping for a chill wknd, to sleep, play tennis, not worry etc
[11/18/17, 11:12:15 AM] Akshay: Now I seem to have it a bit easy, not even too easy because I have an exam Wednesday, but I'm finding it weird
[11/18/17, 11:28:15 AM] Suyash: Similar feeling for me
[11/18/17, 11:29:07 AM] Suyash: But it in these times that you can ponder/wonder about bigger things to do - ones that get sidelined because of HW, tests etc
[11/18/17, 11:47:54 AM] Akshay: Yes
[11/19/17, 3:42:01 PM] Rahul: Dude I just took a nap and remembered the strangest thing
[11/19/17, 3:45:14 PM] Sunil: Lol what happened?
[11/19/17, 3:45:54 PM] Udit: I think he is still typing.....dude how much!
[11/19/17, 3:46:12 PM] Rahul: In 6th grade, Arjun Balu got back his exams for 4 or 5 subjects - don‚Äôt remember which term - and he tried to find the average - he thought that all averages used the denominator 2 instead of the number of subjects - and he only realized the mistake when I told him that his average couldn‚Äôt possibly be more than 100 - and even though he had added 4 or 5 subjects‚Äô marks together - it was only 150 percent
[11/19/17, 3:47:01 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[11/19/17, 3:47:05 PM] Udit: Lol
[11/19/17, 3:49:21 PM] Sunil: Haha üòÇ

[11/25/17, 6:58:45 PM] Akshay: So I was starting to feel sort of miserable because all you can really think about is doing next week's work
[11/25/17, 6:58:57 PM] Akshay: So maybe best if it all rolls through quick
[11/25/17, 6:59:02 PM] Sunil: Yeah same here man

[11/25/17, 7:49:55 PM] Akshay: So obviously non vegetarian food won't be too fun immediately I assume
[11/25/17, 7:51:56 PM] Udit: Yeah but I had to try

[11/26/17, 9:37:10 AM] Rahul: üáÆüá≥

[12/2/17, 10:33:01 AM] Akshay: My last pledged project for caam (matlab) is this weekend, due Monday
[12/2/17, 10:33:07 AM] Suyash: Lol then you're done?
[12/2/17, 10:33:12 AM] Suyash: That's insane, no finals
[12/2/17, 10:33:14 AM] Akshay: Lol wait wanker
[12/2/17, 10:33:23 AM] Akshay: I have a 15 page paper
[12/2/17, 10:33:31 AM] Akshay: And a 5000 word report
[12/2/17, 10:33:42 AM] Suyash: Oh damn
[12/2/17, 10:33:44 AM] Akshay: And a presentation
[12/2/17, 10:34:03 AM] Akshay: And one group paper and presentation already submitted and performed this week
[12/2/17, 10:34:22 AM] Akshay: I had finals but they were not during finals period technically
[12/2/17, 10:34:33 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/2/17, 10:34:54 AM] Akshay: How many pages is 5000 words normal size font 12
[12/2/17, 10:35:31 AM] Suyash: 15

[12/2/17, 10:39:12 AM] Suyash: Classes only end coming Friday, no dead day etc.
[12/2/17, 10:41:34 AM] Akshay: Ahh
[12/2/17, 10:41:37 AM] Akshay: Good luck
[12/2/17, 10:41:40 AM] Akshay: A tight schedule
[12/2/17, 10:42:02 AM] Akshay: Mine is probably less packed but going to take a lot of hours overall
[12/2/17, 10:42:20 AM] Akshay: Lol 15 page paper is hard
[12/2/17, 10:42:33 AM] Suyash: Yeah definitely harder
[12/2/17, 10:42:42 AM] Suyash: Final you're guaranteed it'll be over in 3 hrs
[12/2/17, 10:43:08 AM] Akshay: By the time you get to page 8 or so-the only English words left that you know are nevertheless, furthermore, thus, in addition to etc.
[12/2/17, 10:43:20 AM] Suyash: Lol true
[12/3/17, 7:24:03 PM] Akshay: This might interest you rahul
[12/3/17, 7:24:09 PM] Akshay: What is i^e
[12/3/17, 8:34:18 PM] Rahul: As in imaginary number to the power e?
[12/3/17, 8:45:57 PM] Rahul: I‚Äôm about to sleep- I‚Äôll try tomorrow - but I‚Äôm guessing you would write out the Taylor series for e because i^integer can be simplified easily
[12/6/17, 8:56:09 AM] Suyash: There's a huge wildfire near by - we don't need to evacuate yet. But other places rekt
[12/6/17, 8:57:15 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 9:00:12 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 9:06:41 AM] Rahul: Woah shit
[12/6/17, 9:07:12 AM] Rahul: Be safe
[12/6/17, 9:07:44 AM] Rahul: Cover your nose
[12/6/17, 9:09:29 AM] Akshay: I read about it yesterday- did not know it was near LA. Stay safe mate, wear a mask or something
[12/6/17, 9:09:48 AM] Akshay: Don't need unnecessary particulate matter entering the alveolar sacs of your lungs
[12/6/17, 9:10:26 AM] Akshay: According to my env engineering textbook, the combustion of wood releases particulate matter that is coated with carcinogenic chemicals from soot
[12/6/17, 9:10:32 AM] Akshay: Lol nerdy
[12/6/17, 9:10:37 AM] Akshay: But you get the point
[12/6/17, 9:14:17 AM] Suyash: Yup thanks
[12/6/17, 9:14:46 AM] Suyash: Today was the last class for courses - so some profs reluctant to cancel lol
[12/6/17, 9:14:52 AM] Suyash: In Math rn
[12/6/17, 9:15:07 AM] Suyash: But others have been cancelled :")
[12/6/17, 9:15:32 AM] Akshay: üëçüèæ
[12/6/17, 9:32:20 AM] Rahul: Woah news says most of Southern California
[12/6/17, 9:34:41 AM] Rahul: Dam this happens like every year
[12/6/17, 9:43:21 AM] Akshay: It's happened 3 times this year as well
[12/6/17, 9:50:39 AM] Akshay: Your campus looks epic as well suyash :")
[12/6/17, 9:55:58 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/17, 10:24:08 AM] Suyash: Damn electricity went out
[12/6/17, 10:24:23 AM] Suyash: Need to conserve to be able to study for my final tomorrow ...
[12/6/17, 10:34:50 AM] Akshay: What
[12/6/17, 10:34:53 AM] Akshay: Insane
[12/6/17, 10:34:58 AM] Akshay: Related to the fire?
[12/6/17, 10:37:24 AM] Suyash: Yes
[12/6/17, 10:38:24 AM] Akshay: Oh
[12/6/17, 10:38:40 AM] Akshay: So I guess the university will have to officially sort of "close"
[12/6/17, 10:38:46 AM] Akshay: If this worsens
[12/6/17, 10:39:07 AM] Akshay: Like rice did during Harvey, although campus did not lose power except for two buildings
[12/6/17, 10:51:36 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/17, 10:51:48 AM] Suyash: Dining halls have closed
[12/6/17, 10:52:02 AM] Suyash: Can't make Maagi or anything because no microwave lol
[12/6/17, 10:54:48 AM] Akshay: Oh
[12/6/17, 11:08:36 AM] Suyash: Worse, wifi also going down. No option left but to study now haha
[12/6/17, 11:11:37 AM] Akshay: They might cancel exams for tomorrow
[12/6/17, 11:12:48 AM] Suyash: That's bad, rather be done with it
[12/6/17, 11:18:03 AM] Akshay: Lol without power how will they do the exam though
[12/6/17, 11:18:14 AM] Akshay: And what will people eat etc
[12/6/17, 11:18:20 AM] Akshay: I'm pretty sure they will close
[12/6/17, 11:18:40 AM] Akshay: And if the uni is officially closed it probably becomes illegal for a prof to hold an exam üòÇ
[12/6/17, 11:20:15 AM] Suyash: Haha lol
[12/6/17, 1:57:16 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 2:30:16 PM] Rahul: ‚ÄúCan not communicate...‚Äù
[12/6/17, 2:30:45 PM] Rahul: Warrants open communication
[12/6/17, 2:31:04 PM] Rahul: üòú
[12/6/17, 2:31:45 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/6/17, 2:36:16 PM] Suyash: Woah ice cream looks good
[12/6/17, 2:52:22 PM] Rahul: Better be it was 8$
[12/6/17, 3:17:50 PM] Akshay: Lol the thing is it's actually pretty hard to find people at these places who cheat openly
[12/6/17, 3:17:56 PM] Akshay: Ppl at Rice are pretty scared
[12/6/17, 3:23:56 PM] Suyash: Here it's not like that. With enough ppl, everyone's looking for an advantage haha - also too hard to enforce
[12/6/17, 3:25:19 PM] Suyash: Lol now everyone expects to get the answers from someone else. So no one is studying seriously
[12/6/17, 3:32:23 PM] Rahul: Rice man
[12/6/17, 3:32:42 PM] Rahul: Too nerdy
[12/6/17, 3:34:21 PM] Rahul: Is airport ok tho?
[12/6/17, 3:46:03 PM] Suyash: Yup that's fine
[12/6/17, 3:52:53 PM] Akshay: Very cold in Houston 5 Celsius
[12/6/17, 6:54:56 PM] Suyash: Weather in Dubai looks perfect
[12/6/17, 9:27:55 PM] Akshay: Lol I think this group makes it pretty clear who my best friends from school are haha
[12/6/17, 9:28:28 PM] Akshay: I haven't actually bothered to contact/haven't been contacted by anyone else on a consistent basis. Chatted briefly with Sai and Shalman
[12/6/17, 10:23:57 PM] Suyash: Yup definitely
[12/6/17, 10:24:30 PM] Suyash: A tough question - do you have better mates in school or uni :")
[12/6/17, 10:35:16 PM] Akshay: Not too tough-I believe school
[12/6/17, 10:35:44 PM] Akshay: Uni friends are very good to discuss stuff with, learn from etc-but I think the level of closeness is still less
[12/6/17, 10:35:54 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/6/17, 10:36:07 PM] Akshay: Especially because of intl student vs US student differences etc
[12/6/17, 10:36:39 PM] Akshay: Also we've been through much more together through school
[12/6/17, 10:36:49 PM] Akshay: More years, more experiences
[12/6/17, 10:37:18 PM] Akshay: Uni is rather short tbh-even though the semester seems long-and most of the time you interact with completely different friends for different things
[12/6/17, 10:37:42 PM] Akshay: Like friends in civil engineering class vs club tennis vs my residential college friends at meals etc
[12/6/17, 10:37:54 PM] Suyash: Yes, I have 4 close mates here - all brown
[12/6/17, 10:37:59 PM] Akshay: Whereas in school-tends to usually be just some of us together for most things
[12/6/17, 10:38:13 PM] Suyash: Many more decent-good friends in Dubai for the same reason
[12/6/17, 10:38:19 PM] Akshay: Lol now there is a Pakistani American freshman, similar to my roommate last year
[12/6/17, 10:38:31 PM] Akshay: And an Indian freshman also from Texas
[12/6/17, 10:38:36 PM] Suyash: Many acquaintances here
[12/6/17, 10:38:39 PM] Akshay: The dinner table is banter-filled
[12/6/17, 10:39:16 PM] Akshay: So Zain the other kid from Pakistan-US, said "Bro Pakistan is a day older than India, it's India's older sibling "et al
[12/6/17, 10:39:30 PM] Suyash: Ahhh ffs :")
[12/6/17, 10:39:34 PM] Akshay: I trolled him-"Pakistan is a trial version" et ap
[12/6/17, 10:39:37 PM] Akshay: Al*
[12/6/17, 10:39:45 PM] Suyash: Lol good one
[12/6/17, 10:40:17 PM] Suyash: My roommate, a close mate is Bangladeshi origin - limited competition in that regard :")
[12/6/17, 10:40:18 PM] Akshay: It's light hearted, everyone knows it's meaningless and that none of us REALLY care about this political stuff
[12/6/17, 10:40:22 PM] Akshay: Hahaha
[12/6/17, 10:40:35 PM] Akshay: You are trolling his origins just with that sentence
[12/6/17, 10:40:50 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/7/17, 7:48:48 PM] Akshay: It will snow in Houston tonight
[12/7/17, 7:48:48 PM] Akshay: That's what everyone says
[12/7/17, 7:48:49 PM] Akshay: Sudden drastic temperature drop
[12/7/17, 7:48:49 PM] Akshay: It's apparently snowing in a small suburb called Klein that is 30 miles away
[12/7/17, 7:50:21 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/7/17, 7:50:25 PM] Akshay: 2 am lol
[12/7/17, 8:08:08 PM] Sunil: Damn
[12/7/17, 8:08:26 PM] Sunil: It's really cold out here too, but not sure if it's going to snow
[12/7/17, 8:11:18 PM] Akshay: What temperature in Dallas?
[12/7/17, 8:11:40 PM] Akshay: I heard from someone here who's friend at A and M said it snowed there
[12/7/17, 8:11:44 PM] Akshay: Whose*
[12/7/17, 8:42:21 PM] Akshay: <‚Äévideo omitted>

[12/7/17, 8:49:28 PM] Suyash: Woah amazing
[12/7/17, 8:59:25 PM] Sunil: It's going to drop to -2 around 1am, but rn it's 1 degree

[12/16/17, 7:15:44 PM] Suyash: Yup I've slept from 3-6 AM and PM
[12/16/17, 7:16:04 PM] Suyash: Cool let's do afternoon, avoid the urge to nap
[12/16/17, 7:16:25 PM] Akshay: Yup
[12/16/17, 8:05:32 PM] Rahul: lol I didn't sleep the day before coming here so I took a melatonin and slept at 8 PM yesterday, woke up at 3 today
[12/16/17, 8:06:19 PM] Rahul: 7 hours of good üò¥. Couldn't have woken up a minute earlier even if I wanted to
[12/16/17, 8:06:57 PM] Rahul: I'm free afternoon if you guys want me to come I have some visa work too I'm the morning
[12/16/17, 8:15:08 PM] Suyash: I think now Rahul's place is easier to get to haha
[12/16/17, 9:05:33 PM] Udit: If u guys want I can ask Dylan and ajinkya if u guys want to play in my building
[12/16/17, 9:33:11 PM] Akshay: Is Sunil back too?

[12/16/17, 11:41:17 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/16/17, 11:50:27 PM] Akshay: Not yet raining here but the discrepancy is crazy considering jumeirah isn't all that far away
[12/17/17, 12:01:30 AM] Suyash: Yup lol started raining here too
[12/17/17, 12:30:56 AM] Suyash: So y'all wanna meet up ?

[12/17/17, 1:54:53 AM] Rahul: Can't do today
[12/17/17, 2:07:23 AM] Suyash: Nice that movie is hype
[12/17/17, 2:46:04 AM] Akshay: Ahh lol your third home?
[12/17/17, 2:46:49 AM] Akshay: Do you guys know if school is open still
[12/17/17, 2:46:54 AM] Akshay: We should visit one day
[12/17/17, 2:46:57 AM] Akshay: Meet teachers
[12/17/17, 6:28:20 AM] Suyash: Lol school has been cancelled tomorrow, got flooded :")
[12/17/17, 6:28:32 AM] Akshay: Woah what
[12/17/17, 6:28:51 AM] Akshay: My goodness we are bringing in the natural calamities from the US of A
[12/17/17, 6:28:59 AM] Suyash: Hahaha
[12/17/17, 6:29:02 AM] Akshay: Wildfires, floods, whatever next?
[12/17/17, 6:29:31 AM] Akshay: Snow in RAK
[12/17/17, 6:29:36 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/17/17, 8:02:26 AM] Rahul: Yup my sister is lucky she gets one more day without half her grades
[12/17/17, 8:02:43 AM] Rahul: Movie lives up to hype
[12/17/17, 8:02:50 AM] Rahul: Dam good
[12/17/17, 8:38:31 AM] Akshay: Nice. Dubai mall?
[12/17/17, 9:01:57 AM] Rahul: Mall of Emirates
[12/17/17, 9:02:00 AM] Suyash: Do you guys still have a resident visa?
[12/17/17, 9:02:07 AM] Suyash: Or tourist?
[12/17/17, 9:02:15 AM] Rahul: I am on tourist
[12/17/17, 9:02:22 AM] Rahul: Have been since last year
[12/17/17, 9:02:37 AM] Suyash: Do you need to apply in advance for it?
[12/17/17, 9:02:44 AM] Suyash: Idk what I should get
[12/17/17, 9:03:11 AM] Rahul: Book tickets through Emirates and call them and tell you want to apply for a tourist visa
[12/17/17, 9:03:29 AM] Rahul: They will assist you with single/ multi entry et al
[12/17/17, 9:04:02 AM] Rahul: You will have to submit passport copy and IS visa page online when they send you an email
[12/17/17, 9:04:19 AM] Rahul: Is this for next time?
[12/17/17, 9:04:38 AM] Suyash: My residence expires in a week
[12/17/17, 9:04:38 AM] Rahul: But every time you will need to get a new one
[12/17/17, 9:04:42 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/17/17, 9:04:54 AM] Suyash: I won't be back in 6 months
[12/17/17, 9:04:59 AM] Rahul: Oh shit you're already here and it expires
[12/17/17, 9:05:01 AM] Suyash: So cannot retain residence visa anyway
[12/17/17, 9:05:04 AM] Suyash: Yea
[12/17/17, 9:05:06 AM] Rahul: That might be a problem
[12/17/17, 9:05:15 AM] Suyash: I'm already here so :")
[12/17/17, 9:05:17 AM] Rahul: Lemme ask my dad
[12/17/17, 9:05:39 AM] Rahul: U might have to pay and/or have trouble coming back one you leave
[12/17/17, 9:06:32 AM] Suyash: Right
[12/17/17, 9:07:07 AM] Suyash: Residence visa costs more too
[12/17/17, 9:07:08 AM] Rahul: You might have to book a blank trip to India or something
[12/17/17, 9:07:25 AM] Rahul: My dada says he's not completely sure - but the tourist visa gets issued quickly
[12/17/17, 9:07:39 AM] Suyash: Cool, thanks
[12/17/17, 9:08:57 AM] Rahul: So u could ask your dad to book you a 2 day trip to India before resident visa expires and start tourist visa process for when you come back at same time
[12/17/17, 9:09:26 AM] Suyash: Okay
[12/17/17, 9:09:30 AM] Suyash: That's too much work
[12/17/17, 9:09:44 AM] Suyash: Rather just renew resident visa lol
[12/17/17, 9:09:59 AM] Rahul: Is that possible tho?
[12/17/17, 9:10:22 AM] Rahul: I thought male, over 18 means you can't be dependent anymore once it expires
[12/17/17, 9:10:37 AM] Suyash: I've heard that too
[12/17/17, 9:10:54 AM] Suyash: But my dad said the office can get it done
[12/17/17, 9:12:23 AM] Rahul: Well that's prolly the best option then
[12/17/17, 9:13:22 AM] Suyash: I wonder, what can happen now that I'm in the country
[12/17/17, 9:13:26 AM] Suyash: And my Visa expires
[12/17/17, 9:13:35 AM] Suyash: They'll only know when I'm leaving anyways
[12/17/17, 10:07:55 AM] Akshay: Resident, has to be renewed each year
[12/17/17, 11:41:03 AM] Akshay: I'll have tennis tomorrow afternoon. So if we need to meet it will have to be morning or later evening
[12/17/17, 7:31:59 PM] Akshay: Would you guys be interested in going to watch mubadala tennis
[12/17/17, 7:32:21 PM] Akshay: I was telling my father that I was interested in going to watch
[12/17/17, 8:02:34 PM] Suyash: Sure, whose playing?
[12/17/17, 8:02:57 PM] Suyash: Also I'm down to meet today morning or later in the evening
[12/17/17, 8:38:33 PM] Akshay: I think Nadal, Djokovic, wawrinka, carreno busta, and two more
[12/17/17, 8:38:39 PM] Akshay: Don't remember completely
[12/17/17, 8:40:49 PM] Akshay: I'd also be down to meet at either of your houses to play PS, something I haven't done in a while
[12/17/17, 8:40:54 PM] Akshay: That would be fun too
[12/17/17, 8:41:27 PM] Akshay: I'm sort of wary about sports, just trying to recover from knee injury. Today I'm playing tennis after 2 weeks as well
[12/17/17, 9:09:16 PM] Suyash: Yup I'll prolly gym today
[12/17/17, 9:09:32 PM] Suyash: We can get dinner somewhere in Karama, cheap good food
[12/17/17, 9:10:02 PM] Suyash: Ah I have played PS every night in uni, not an exaggeration. Left mine there
[12/17/17, 9:10:33 PM] Suyash: The lineup is pretty good - should go for Nadal v Djok or Djok v Waw
[12/18/17, 12:25:17 AM] Akshay: My tennis class is on sheikh zayed road. So after that I'd be willing to come to either of your houses if we are playing
[12/18/17, 12:25:19 AM] Akshay: Let me know
[12/18/17, 1:02:05 AM] Suyash: Rahul can we play TT at your house?
[12/18/17, 1:56:55 AM] Akshay: Raonic and thiem also coming for mubadala
[12/18/17, 1:57:04 AM] Akshay: We should buy tickets soon if you all are interested
[12/18/17, 1:57:22 AM] Akshay: The second day is probably best but more expensive than the first
[12/18/17, 2:02:16 AM] Rahul: TT table broke, not able to fix yet
[12/18/17, 2:02:24 AM] Rahul: Squash/ tennis is possible
[12/18/17, 2:06:29 AM] Akshay: Can we play at around 6+
[12/18/17, 2:06:41 AM] Akshay: My class ends at 5, is pretty close to world trade centre
[12/18/17, 2:06:50 AM] Akshay: Can come after that, directly
[12/18/17, 2:06:58 AM] Suyash: Yup let's do it
[12/18/17, 2:07:18 AM] Suyash: I'm craving Jabal Al Noor or similar
[12/18/17, 2:07:33 AM] Akshay: I will bring my racquet etc, let me know
[12/18/17, 2:07:33 AM] Akshay: Let's do squash, not tennis
[12/18/17, 2:07:52 AM] Akshay: Lol I'm not sure of food plans, but let's meet
[12/18/17, 2:08:02 AM] Suyash: I can meet you at WTC station
[12/18/17, 2:09:58 AM] Rahul: Yeah ok squash at 6
[12/18/17, 2:12:34 AM] Akshay: Hmm maybe. Mine is actually beyond the next station
[12/18/17, 2:12:35 AM] Akshay: We'll discuss that, but let rahul confirm playing
[12/18/17, 2:12:36 AM] Akshay: I'd prefer squash I guess, haven't played in a while
[12/18/17, 2:13:17 AM] Rahul: ^?
[12/18/17, 2:14:12 AM] Akshay: Yup
[12/18/17, 2:21:43 AM] Suyash: Cool so we on for squash at 6?
[12/18/17, 2:22:13 AM] Rahul: Yeah I'll. ok the court
[12/18/17, 2:22:17 AM] Rahul: *book
[12/18/17, 2:25:49 AM] Akshay: Yes
[12/18/17, 2:26:19 AM] Suyash: Should check the bus timing
[12/18/17, 2:52:13 AM] Rahul: Court booked till 7
[12/18/17, 2:52:20 AM] Rahul: I booked 7 to 9
[12/18/17, 3:15:27 AM] Rahul: Can you guys come at 7?
[12/18/17, 10:10:19 PM] Akshay: Let's buy the tickets this afternoon for mubadala
[12/18/17, 10:10:32 PM] Akshay: I say second day, the outer tier is good. 250 bucks
[12/18/17, 10:42:41 PM] Suyash: Yes, I just have to confirm with my parents
[12/18/17, 10:42:55 PM] Suyash: Any idea who is playing / how many matches?
[12/19/17, 1:36:21 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/19/17, 2:36:18 AM] Akshay: Yup
[12/19/17, 9:23:45 AM] Suyash: I'm down for it
[12/19/17, 9:23:54 AM] Suyash: You guys?
[12/19/17, 9:25:39 AM] Sunil: So when is this happening?
[12/19/17, 9:25:47 AM] Udit: When is it?
[12/19/17, 9:31:20 AM] Suyash: 29th
[12/19/17, 10:28:48 AM] Akshay: Yes
[12/19/17, 10:36:16 AM] Akshay: Let's confirm soon, tickets will run out. Lol I'm checking right now about the availability
[12/19/17, 10:36:38 AM] Akshay: Rahul are you keen as well
[12/19/17, 10:36:50 AM] Akshay: And how do you think we can get there, if we go
[12/19/17, 10:38:26 AM] Suyash: Yup I'm confirmed
[12/19/17, 10:38:41 AM] Suyash: There's a bus that goes to AD for 25 bucks, pretty good
[12/19/17, 10:44:31 AM] Akshay: Ahh that's nice
[12/19/17, 10:44:51 AM] Suyash: Easy to get a cab from there to the tennis stadium
[12/19/17, 10:44:59 AM] Akshay: Yes
[12/19/17, 10:45:14 AM] Suyash: AD public transport is noticeably cheaper than Dubai
[12/19/17, 10:45:28 AM] Akshay: Speaking of public transport
[12/19/17, 10:45:41 AM] Suyash: A couple years back, there was no minimum fare - started at 3 bucks
[12/19/17, 10:46:00 AM] Akshay: Last night after squash, I tried the genius move of going by bus from burjuman to somewhere closer to my house instead of oud metha metro station
[12/19/17, 10:46:06 AM] Akshay: Missed the stop or whatever idk
[12/19/17, 10:46:26 AM] Akshay: The bus went onto the al ain road highway and the next stop was all the way in silicon oasis
[12/19/17, 10:46:42 AM] Akshay: Had to call my dad, ask him to come pick me up
[12/19/17, 10:46:45 AM] Akshay: Never again haha
[12/19/17, 10:46:49 AM] Suyash: Ah fuck
[12/19/17, 10:47:08 AM] Suyash: Parents would be pissed :")
[12/19/17, 10:47:11 AM] Akshay: I expected three stops within the oud metha area
[12/19/17, 10:47:18 AM] Akshay: There were only 2
[12/19/17, 10:47:47 AM] Akshay: I was more pissed tbh, because I was so sleepy and hungry
[12/19/17, 10:47:49 AM] Suyash: Same happened once I was going to Rahul's house. Took 20 mins to come around
[12/19/17, 10:47:53 AM] Suyash: Yup definitely
[12/19/17, 10:48:17 AM] Akshay: Udit are you going to be here in December
[12/19/17, 10:48:22 AM] Udit: U guys wanna play squash again?
[12/19/17, 10:48:22 AM] Akshay: Or in India?
[12/19/17, 10:48:33 AM] Udit: I actually just came to Dubai
[12/19/17, 10:48:44 AM] Akshay: Ahh nice
[12/19/17, 10:48:51 AM] Akshay: I can't play tomorrow I think
[12/19/17, 10:49:02 AM] Akshay: Have tennis
[12/19/17, 10:49:02 AM] Udit: Ah alright
[12/19/17, 10:50:59 AM] Suyash: So when are you here till Udit?
[12/19/17, 10:52:59 AM] Udit: Well my flight is for 10th jan
[12/19/17, 10:53:11 AM] Udit: But I may hv to go to India
[12/19/17, 8:00:16 PM] Akshay: Updated info, tickets seem to be available
[12/19/17, 8:00:17 PM] Akshay: But for day 2, the outermost seating category, it says there is a fee of 35 bucks per seat
[12/19/17, 8:00:18 PM] Akshay: On ticketmaster, which is what the mubadala site linked me to for buying tickets
[12/19/17, 8:00:18 PM] Akshay: So it gets very pricey at 285
[12/19/17, 8:00:19 PM] Akshay: Maybe we could just watch the first day instead, the fee attached to that was 15 bucks and the price is also 100 as opposed to 250. For the outer seats
[12/19/17, 8:00:19 PM] Akshay: So pay 115, get to watch wawrinka vs carreno busta and raonic vs thiem
[12/19/17, 8:04:17 PM] Akshay: We should decide today. Rahul, Sunil?
[12/19/17, 8:04:46 PM] Akshay: I think for me the first day seems a nice option too. Else it starts to get too expensive, include transport etc.
[12/19/17, 8:10:40 PM] Sunil: I'm down for it üëç
[12/19/17, 8:18:00 PM] Akshay: Which day
[12/19/17, 8:39:14 PM] Suyash: Ah true it gets pricey
[12/19/17, 8:39:51 PM] Suyash: But 300 bucks is worth to watch Nadal, Djoko and Wawrinka :)
[12/19/17, 8:55:06 PM] Akshay: Probably not at mubadala though haha, idk if they play serious
[12/19/17, 8:55:19 PM] Akshay: I mean they definitely do, they don't play it like an exhibition
[12/19/17, 8:55:21 PM] Akshay: But still
[12/19/17, 8:55:36 PM] Akshay: Nadal played decent last year
[12/19/17, 8:56:07 PM] Akshay: Also wawrinka is not a guarantee on second day, he might lose the first
[12/19/17, 8:56:32 PM] Akshay: And raonic, thiem good as well
[12/19/17, 9:09:32 PM] Suyash: On the 2nd day, there's 3 matches. So we can see all players (the losers of yesterday too)
[12/19/17, 9:09:45 PM] Suyash: Tbh, I'm going only for Nadal :P
[12/19/17, 9:10:10 PM] Suyash: I think if we buy tickets in a store, won't need to pay 35 bucks extra
[12/19/17, 9:24:38 PM] Akshay: Yup
[12/19/17, 9:24:46 PM] Akshay: Is the second day 3 matches?
[12/19/17, 9:25:41 PM] Akshay: Ahh that's pretty cool
[12/19/17, 9:25:52 PM] Akshay: I'd be good for that too-basically you see every player
[12/19/17, 9:26:12 PM] Akshay: I didn't remember that they did the 5th place play off
[12/19/17, 9:27:23 PM] Akshay: Do you know where to buy tickets
[12/19/17, 9:27:44 PM] Akshay: My dad has gone before, said the second day is best
[12/19/17, 9:29:13 PM] Akshay: Virgin megastores. Is any of you near one?
[12/19/17, 9:30:02 PM] Akshay: Ok so me, suyash, Sunil all confirmed I guess?
[12/19/17, 9:30:10 PM] Akshay: Rahul and udit, reply quick
[12/19/17, 9:31:45 PM] Suyash: There is one in Burjuman, I might go there today
[12/19/17, 9:33:34 PM] Akshay: Ok
[12/19/17, 9:37:52 PM] Udit: Yeah I don't mind
[12/19/17, 9:38:18 PM] Udit: I mean I can go to burjuman
[12/19/17, 9:38:23 PM] Udit: It's closest to me
[12/19/17, 9:41:37 PM] Sunil: So we are going on Saturday now right?
[12/19/17, 9:41:53 PM] Akshay: 29th dec
[12/19/17, 9:42:12 PM] Akshay: Friday I think
[12/19/17, 9:42:19 PM] Sunil: Alright
[12/19/17, 9:43:08 PM] Sunil: Do you guys want to play today ?
[12/19/17, 9:47:15 PM] Akshay: I can't in the morning, also mostly not in the evening
[12/19/17, 10:48:05 PM] Rahul: Yeah I can come
[12/19/17, 10:48:27 PM] Rahul: üëÜüèΩI mean for mubadala
[12/19/17, 10:48:52 PM] Udit: So where do u guys want to buy the tickets fmr
[12/19/17, 10:49:01 PM] Udit: From*
[12/19/17, 11:12:33 PM] Suyash: It is sold at Virgin Megastore
[12/19/17, 11:13:07 PM] Suyash: Idk if we get to pick seats or what
[12/19/17, 11:13:39 PM] Udit: It's probably zones
[12/19/17, 11:13:47 PM] Udit: Like football
[12/19/17, 11:14:06 PM] Suyash: Yes
[12/20/17, 2:03:35 AM] Akshay: It's zones and seat numbers
[12/20/17, 2:03:47 AM] Akshay: But I think all the matters is having seats together
[12/20/17, 2:04:17 AM] Akshay: Plus if you buy at a store it's probably easy to see where the seat is, best get it close to the middle as opposed to the exact side
[12/20/17, 2:04:50 AM] Akshay: I think you can do it online too but it has that charge, plus it told me to install some flash player plugin or something
[12/20/17, 2:04:54 AM] Akshay: Idk about that
[12/20/17, 3:28:31 AM] Akshay: Hello
[12/20/17, 3:28:42 AM] Akshay: Tomorrow is the last day of school it seems
[12/20/17, 3:28:48 AM] Akshay: Do you all want to go tomorrow, to meet teachers
[12/20/17, 3:28:51 AM] Akshay: Been a while
[12/20/17, 3:29:57 AM] Akshay: We should go early if possible
[12/20/17, 3:30:51 AM] Akshay: Well, that is if school is happening and is not cancelled. Rahul?
[12/20/17, 4:56:29 AM] Rahul: My sister says ni school
[12/20/17, 4:56:34 AM] Rahul: Today was open house
[12/20/17, 5:27:18 AM] Akshay: Oh ok haha
[12/20/17, 5:31:12 AM] Akshay: Forget it then, can't go if they are having open house or no school
[12/20/17, 5:43:14 AM] Akshay: Ahh I read something that wawrinka and raonic withdrew from mubadala
[12/20/17, 5:43:28 AM] Akshay: https://www.google.ae/amp/metro.co.uk/2017/12/20/stan-wawrinka-milos-raonic-pull-abu-dhabi-exhibition-featuring-novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-7174068/amp/
[12/20/17, 6:10:26 AM] Udit: Oh shit
[12/20/17, 6:11:38 AM] Udit: U guys free for squash tmr?
[12/20/17, 6:12:16 AM] Suyash: üëç
[12/20/17, 6:12:51 AM] Udit: We can decide on purchasing the tickets then as well
[12/20/17, 6:13:03 AM] Akshay: Yeah probably morning
[12/20/17, 6:44:48 AM] Rahul: Boo this better be early
[12/20/17, 6:44:51 AM] Rahul: *boi
[12/20/17, 6:45:00 AM] Rahul: My extended family is coming at 2
[12/20/17, 6:56:32 AM] Udit: Ha sure man
[12/20/17, 6:56:37 AM] Udit: 8?
[12/20/17, 6:56:50 AM] Udit: Damn we hv 3 places for squash now
[12/20/17, 7:12:32 AM] Rahul: Yeah 8 is fine
[12/20/17, 7:12:38 AM] Rahul: Effectively 2 lol
[12/20/17, 7:12:57 AM] Rahul: Mine might be good in terms of location but court is small and slippery
[12/20/17, 8:09:56 AM] Suyash: 8 is way too early
[12/20/17, 8:10:17 AM] Suyash: Udits house?
[12/20/17, 8:24:43 AM] Rahul: Max like 9:30 I can't come after that
[12/20/17, 8:30:53 AM] Akshay: Rahul dude 2 is a long time away
[12/20/17, 8:31:02 AM] Akshay: I think the court at my place is pretty good as well
[12/20/17, 8:31:15 AM] Akshay: Want to come?
[12/20/17, 8:33:48 AM] Rahul: Baba play - come back shower, eat, clean my room- go to supermarket for supplies - be at airport by 1:45
[12/20/17, 8:34:07 AM] Rahul: Can't make it unless we plan on playing for like 1 hour
[12/20/17, 8:34:31 AM] Rahul: I can come anywhere
[12/20/17, 8:34:37 AM] Rahul: What's address
[12/20/17, 8:34:46 AM] Suyash: Udits house is more convenient
[12/20/17, 8:34:47 AM] Suyash: For me
[12/20/17, 8:35:09 AM] Akshay: My house is more convenient
[12/20/17, 8:35:11 AM] Akshay: For me
[12/20/17, 8:35:16 AM] Akshay: üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:35:19 AM] Sunil: I'm okay with either Udit or Akshay's house
[12/20/17, 8:35:22 AM] Sunil: Ofc üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:35:24 AM] Suyash: Yup ofc haha
[12/20/17, 8:35:27 AM] Akshay: I mean I don't mind coming to udit's place
[12/20/17, 8:35:35 AM] Akshay: Fin let's do udit
[12/20/17, 8:35:45 AM] Sunil: How abt 9 then if 8 is too early
[12/20/17, 8:35:58 AM] Rahul: Fine with 9 too
[12/20/17, 8:36:00 AM] Akshay: 9 is good
[12/20/17, 8:36:08 AM] Akshay: 8 is too early
[12/20/17, 8:36:13 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/20/17, 8:36:21 AM] Akshay: Rahul, is 10 too late? 10-12
[12/20/17, 8:36:40 AM] Akshay: Go home by 1, quick shower, be ready 45 minutes before your extended family arrives
[12/20/17, 8:36:42 AM] Suyash: 10 is ideal
[12/20/17, 8:37:05 AM] Rahul: Yeah ten to twelve is too late because it'll be 12:20 when I get back
[12/20/17, 8:37:08 AM] Akshay: And with your driver, you can get home much earlier than 1
[12/20/17, 8:37:27 AM] Akshay: Dude walk fast, you'll get there by 12!
[12/20/17, 8:38:18 AM] Suyash: Rahul are you fine with playing for less than 2 hrs
[12/20/17, 8:38:29 AM] Rahul: I can do max 9:30 to 11:30 or earlier
[12/20/17, 8:38:35 AM] Rahul: Yah I'm fine with that
[12/20/17, 8:38:47 AM] Akshay: Alright let's do 9:45.
[12/20/17, 8:38:53 AM] Rahul: Honestly I'll just get there early if anyone else wants to come early and play
[12/20/17, 8:39:04 AM] Akshay: Suits everyone-compromise between rahul and the others
[12/20/17, 8:39:48 AM] Akshay: 9:45-11:45 rahul. Then by your estimate, you'll get home by 12:05. There's plenty time to prepare for the arrival of the esteemed guests.
[12/20/17, 8:40:04 AM] Akshay: üëåüèæ
[12/20/17, 8:40:09 AM] Rahul: Esteemed yeah
[12/20/17, 8:40:44 AM] Rahul: I'll be there by 9:30 you guys take your time
[12/20/17, 8:40:58 AM] Rahul: I'll leave by 11:30 tho
[12/20/17, 8:42:15 AM] Rahul: First question when my aunt sees me: "what grade did you get in math?"
[12/20/17, 8:42:48 AM] Akshay: What grade did you get?
[12/20/17, 8:42:55 AM] Rahul: A lol
[12/20/17, 8:43:13 AM] Rahul: Last two years it has become a futile attempt for her
[12/20/17, 8:43:46 AM] Akshay: Ha, still valid if she knows about A+
[12/20/17, 8:43:51 AM] Akshay: If OS gives A+
[12/20/17, 8:44:00 AM] Rahul: There is no A+ at OS
[12/20/17, 8:44:07 AM] Akshay: That's good
[12/20/17, 8:44:32 AM] Rahul: And if theee was I would ups have got it anyway
[12/20/17, 8:45:56 AM] Sunil: Cal 3?
[12/20/17, 8:46:18 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[12/20/17, 8:46:39 AM] Sunil: Nice
[12/20/17, 8:47:16 AM] Rahul: And honestly once you're past school it's a bit hard for people to bully you in these matters. Especially when you're a tutor teaching calc 1 and 2
[12/20/17, 8:48:13 AM] Rahul: At that point if someone questions mathematical abilities, they're either pretty dam good at math or being hypocritical
[12/20/17, 8:48:39 AM] Akshay: I openly question and criticize your mathematical abilities.
[12/20/17, 8:49:00 AM] Akshay: I believe you are unfit to be a tutor for calc 1 and 2 at OS
[12/20/17, 8:49:17 AM] Rahul: Thanks buddy
[12/20/17, 8:49:40 AM] Akshay: Why
[12/20/17, 8:49:52 AM] Rahul: I'm not going to argue lol bye
[12/20/17, 8:49:57 AM] Akshay: Shit
[12/20/17, 8:50:08 AM] Akshay: Needed to start a debate, make it funny
[12/20/17, 8:50:23 AM] Sunil: Lol I always felt Rahul was really good at math tbh
[12/20/17, 8:51:02 AM] Akshay: Time to be really savage.


He is really good at math... Compared to you!
[12/20/17, 8:51:51 AM] Sunil: Haha I like this banter üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:52:06 AM] Sunil: Even though it's not true
[12/20/17, 8:52:19 AM] Rahul: üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:52:23 AM] Sunil: Let's not compare each other lol
[12/20/17, 8:52:39 AM] Rahul: Yeah enough
[12/20/17, 8:52:57 AM] Akshay: Why, are you guys busy
[12/20/17, 8:53:06 AM] Akshay: Sunil probably jet lagged more though, I agree
[12/20/17, 8:53:17 AM] Sunil: True
[12/20/17, 8:53:35 AM] Sunil: Tbh I'm not even sure if I can wake up by 9 tmrw üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:53:36 AM] Akshay: Tbh it's very hard to compare academic performance at different unis
[12/20/17, 8:53:49 AM] Sunil: Bc I took this long nap today
[12/20/17, 8:54:21 AM] Akshay: Because although the material is standardized, for some reason I feel it's reasonably easy to get high grades in some Rice classes. Although it is highly competitive
[12/20/17, 8:54:48 AM] Akshay: I think there is grade inflation at Rice, for example we have A+
[12/20/17, 8:54:54 AM] Akshay: At OS no
[12/20/17, 8:55:13 AM] Akshay: Professor makes a huge difference for social sciences and humanities
[12/20/17, 8:55:27 AM] Akshay: They hold literally every single key to your success
[12/20/17, 8:55:39 AM] Sunil: Honestly they make a huge difference for every subject
[12/20/17, 8:55:40 AM] Akshay: You can write an epic essay, and have it given a B
[12/20/17, 8:56:00 AM] Sunil: Bc some teachers just make an easy course a hell lot tougher for no reason
[12/20/17, 8:56:12 AM] Sunil: Or vice versa
[12/20/17, 8:56:16 AM] Akshay: They do in terms of teaching quality-but I think in science or engineering the answers are more absolute-there can only be right or wrong
[12/20/17, 8:56:32 AM] Sunil: True
[12/20/17, 8:56:56 AM] Akshay: You rarely will write an epic answer which is marked wrong. Usually something is missing, or at least the prof will point it out
[12/20/17, 8:57:10 AM] Akshay: In sociology they give B grades with no explanation at all üòÇ
[12/20/17, 8:57:12 AM] Sunil: But what I meant that the grading scheme, as in weightage, curving, all depends on the teacher
[12/20/17, 8:57:24 AM] Akshay: Very true
[12/20/17, 8:58:34 AM] Rahul: Yeah true. Especially curves tend to vary widely.
[12/20/17, 8:59:11 AM] Rahul: And writing classes also very variable
[12/20/17, 9:00:09 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[12/20/17, 9:35:38 AM] Udit: Ok..
[12/20/17, 9:35:56 AM] Udit: So u guys cming tmr morning 9?
[12/20/17, 10:44:17 AM] Suyash: We agreed at 10 right?
[12/20/17, 10:49:28 AM] Akshay: 9:45 was agreed.
[12/20/17, 10:54:45 AM] Suyash: üëç
[12/20/17, 6:49:01 PM] Akshay: Don't forget to get the money for the tickets
[12/20/17, 6:49:06 PM] Akshay: We can go buy after playing
[12/20/17, 6:49:13 PM] Akshay: Everyone good for second day?
[12/20/17, 6:49:24 PM] Akshay: Then it'll be 250. Best bring 300 in case.
[12/20/17, 6:49:38 PM] Udit: üëå
[12/20/17, 6:49:50 PM] Akshay: Because we are hoping that the 30 bucks fee is not going to be included if we buy on the spot at the store
[12/20/17, 7:11:25 PM] Akshay: How does one switch from red to green line at burjuman, while going toward etisalat, and wanting to switch towards creek
[12/20/17, 7:22:43 PM] Suyash: ^ that is a loaded question
[12/20/17, 7:23:36 PM] Akshay: Haha. Is there a straight answer?
[12/20/17, 7:23:55 PM] Suyash: I didn't fully get the question
[12/20/17, 7:24:23 PM] Suyash: You can't go towards etisalat and be on the red line
[12/20/17, 7:24:23 PM] Akshay: Sorry I made a mistake
[12/20/17, 7:24:51 PM] Akshay: I mean going towards rashidiya* on the red, and wanting to switch towards creek
[12/20/17, 7:26:24 PM] Suyash: Just get off and look for the sign to Creek lol
[12/20/17, 7:26:46 PM] Suyash: Have you not switched lines before :")
[12/20/17, 7:27:01 PM] Akshay: Well, unless I'm blind af that simple plan would succeed, and did occur to me
[12/20/17, 7:27:30 PM] Akshay: But from the rashidiya platform, going one floor up allows me to switch onto green line towards etisalat
[12/20/17, 7:28:00 PM] Akshay: And one floor above that, is the top floor where basically I had to swipe and come out
[12/20/17, 7:28:09 PM] Suyash: No dude
[12/20/17, 7:28:16 PM] Akshay: And then on the other side, I had to swipe in again for creek
[12/20/17, 7:28:20 PM] Suyash: That is not possible / you must've messed up
[12/20/17, 7:28:38 PM] Suyash: Just look for the sign
[12/20/17, 7:28:42 PM] Suyash: Creek is on one end
[12/20/17, 7:28:46 PM] Akshay: That's the conclusion I arrived at, hence the lame and ignorant questions lol
[12/20/17, 7:28:47 PM] Suyash: Etisalat on the other
[12/20/17, 7:28:52 PM] Suyash: Of the same floor
[12/20/17, 7:29:04 PM] Suyash: So it matters from where you take the escalator
[12/20/17, 7:29:26 PM] Akshay: Ahh. Ok.
[12/20/17, 7:29:36 PM] Akshay: That might have been it
[12/20/17, 7:29:44 PM] Akshay: Because I was fumbling around yesterday
[12/20/17, 7:30:03 PM] Akshay: I've never had to make that particular line switch thus far in all my years of using the metro
[12/20/17, 7:30:24 PM] Akshay: Infact, having burjuman close to home, I've barely had to switch lines at all
[12/20/17, 7:30:32 PM] Akshay: Nowadays it is more inconvenient
[12/20/17, 8:07:18 PM] Suyash: https://www.thenational.ae/sport/tennis/anderson-and-rublev-replace-wawrinka-and-raonic-at-mubadala-world-tennis-championship-1.689321
[12/20/17, 8:07:21 PM] Suyash: Ffs
[12/20/17, 8:07:57 PM] Suyash: Should've got Kyrgios, Dimitrov, Zverev etc.
[12/20/17, 8:20:07 PM] Akshay: Anderson is epic
[12/20/17, 8:20:26 PM] Akshay: Zverev is boring imo. Kyrgios epic, dimitrov good too
[12/20/17, 8:37:11 PM] Sunil: Does anyone want to play at 9 itself
[12/21/17, 2:22:38 AM] Akshay: We went to virgin in dcc
[12/21/17, 2:22:39 AM] Akshay: There also ticket price is 285
[12/21/17, 2:22:39 AM] Akshay: So we didn't buy thinking we can just do it online
[12/21/17, 2:22:40 AM] Akshay: Now the question is deciding whether we even want to go
[12/21/17, 2:22:40 AM] Akshay: Considering all costs of transport and food as well
[12/21/17, 2:22:54 AM] Akshay: What is the general opinion
[12/21/17, 2:23:00 AM] Akshay: Plenty of tickets left
[12/21/17, 2:47:14 AM] Rahul: Let's just go
[12/21/17, 2:48:12 AM] Rahul: I need the assurance of my freedom for at least one of the next 10 days
[12/21/17, 3:04:12 AM] Udit: Lol
[12/21/17, 3:10:55 AM] Akshay: Ok. What about you guys
[12/21/17, 3:11:04 AM] Akshay: Should ask parents et al and decide
[12/21/17, 3:18:55 AM] Suyash: I can go too, 35 AED extra is not so bad if you're paying 250 AED anyway
[12/21/17, 3:19:18 AM] Suyash: Rahul can oy
[12/21/17, 3:19:29 AM] Suyash: *Rahul can your driver drop us?
[12/21/17, 6:49:18 AM] Rahul: May not be
[12/21/17, 6:49:32 AM] Rahul: We are 5
[12/21/17, 6:49:41 AM] Rahul: Only 4 ppl fit in car anyway
[12/21/17, 6:50:42 AM] Rahul: It depends what plans fam has for that day
[12/21/17, 7:39:00 AM] Udit: Don't u hv a mesarati
[12/21/17, 7:39:12 AM] Udit: I can drive üëå
[12/21/17, 7:49:50 AM] Suyash: Lol didn't you have a Chevrolet/GMC 6 seater?
[12/21/17, 8:17:34 AM] Akshay: If transport is by bus et al-remember the costs of returning too
[12/21/17, 8:17:48 AM] Akshay: My dad said food is ridiculously expensive in and around the tournament
[12/21/17, 8:18:08 AM] Akshay: And given the duration we are bound to buy something there even if we eat elsewhere lol
[12/21/17, 8:18:35 AM] Akshay: All in all he said the cost will be like 500 per person everything included
[12/21/17, 8:19:21 AM] Akshay: Lol-if one is in UK-Wimbledon QF can be viewed at similar price-along with the ability to watch matches on other courts with the grounds pass
[12/21/17, 8:19:29 AM] Akshay: Lol UAE-always the same shit
[12/21/17, 8:19:56 AM] Akshay: Remember the real Madrid vs Milan match we watched-suyash, Sunil?
[12/21/17, 8:20:28 AM] Akshay: Suyash bought something to eat, cost like 50 bucks for something relatively simple
[12/21/17, 8:24:38 AM] Sunil: Oh yeah I remember that event
[12/21/17, 8:24:45 AM] Sunil: Way too overpriced
[12/21/17, 8:25:39 AM] Sunil: I'm honestly having second thoughts about going for mubaddala
[12/21/17, 8:26:09 AM] Akshay: Same haha
[12/21/17, 8:26:19 AM] Akshay: Anyone interested in the first day?
[12/21/17, 8:26:29 AM] Akshay: Ticket would be 115
[12/21/17, 8:27:40 AM] Rahul: We sold bug Chevy - now gave Chevy Malibu instead
[12/21/17, 8:28:02 AM] Akshay: Damn
[12/21/17, 8:28:09 AM] Akshay: So which cars do you have now
[12/21/17, 8:28:13 AM] Rahul: *big
[12/21/17, 8:28:25 AM] Rahul: Chevy Malibu and Maserati
[12/21/17, 8:28:48 AM] Suyash: Unrelated, but Y'all want to go for cycling instead?
[12/21/17, 8:29:14 AM] Rahul: Didn't I tell you lol this happened in summer itself , no no no no cycling
[12/21/17, 8:29:31 AM] Rahul: I dint mums first day
[12/21/17, 8:29:34 AM] Akshay: Physical activities already causing some pain in my knee lol will give it a pass
[12/21/17, 8:30:04 AM] Rahul: *i don't mind first day
[12/21/17, 8:30:33 AM] Suyash: I don't mind second day or cycling
[12/21/17, 8:30:47 AM] Suyash: Not really interested in first day
[12/21/17, 8:32:23 AM] Sunil: Same I'm not too I interested in the first day
[12/21/17, 6:23:37 PM] Rahul: The only common thing is second day
[12/22/17, 5:49:20 PM] Akshay: Lol Nadal not coming to mubadala either
[12/22/17, 7:44:09 PM] Suyash: Haha Akshay you have saved us with your skepticism!
[12/22/17, 7:44:18 PM] Suyash: Y'all free to play squash today?

[12/23/17, 3:59:08 AM] Akshay: Lol raonic an absolute wanker
[12/23/17, 3:59:16 AM] Akshay: It doesn't seem like he's injured specifically
[12/23/17, 3:59:33 AM] Akshay: Just wanted to get to Australia quicker for better prep for more serious tournaments
[12/23/17, 3:59:52 AM] Akshay: Probably sensible for him-but still a bad move towards mubadala
[12/23/17, 5:22:41 AM] Akshay: I thought Madrid were senational in the first half
[12/23/17, 5:22:57 AM] Akshay: But in the space of ten minutes they have been destroyed
[12/23/17, 5:23:06 AM] Akshay: Now ten men and 2 down lolol fuck
[12/23/17, 5:23:22 AM] Akshay: I hate fcb
[12/23/17, 5:50:35 AM] Akshay: Oh god the one football match I watchüòÇ
[12/23/17, 6:20:34 AM] Suyash: I prefer Barca over Madrid, but like Atletico most in La Liga
[12/23/17, 6:20:45 AM] Suyash: Why do you hate Barca!?
[12/23/17, 6:38:46 AM] Akshay: I feel they get too lucky
[12/23/17, 6:39:19 AM] Akshay: Have seen them progress in UCL too many times through bs like away goals when they clearly didn't deserve to in terms of football played
[12/23/17, 6:39:30 AM] Akshay: Although I suppose they were deserving by the rules
[12/23/17, 6:40:12 AM] Akshay: Plus it's a case of overpowering-if you have messi and players who support him so well, it's not too difficult, or doesn't seem difficult to win
[12/23/17, 6:40:39 AM] Akshay: Plus I like ronaldo more than messi and would like to see him score more, win more
[12/23/17, 6:40:40 AM] Akshay: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[12/23/17, 6:40:43 AM] Akshay: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[12/23/17, 6:41:22 AM] Akshay: And ofc it's weird because real Madrid is also packed with epic players
[12/23/17, 6:47:54 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/23/17, 6:48:20 AM] Suyash: I feel Madrid is too OP, always gets lucky
[12/23/17, 6:48:40 AM] Suyash: Versus Bayern, Atletico in previous years
[12/23/17, 6:53:19 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/23/17, 9:33:42 AM] Akshay: Hahaha. A rash move by him, impulsive.
[12/23/17, 9:34:02 AM] Akshay: I think the delete think is a new feature of whatsapp
[12/23/17, 9:34:07 AM] Akshay: Thing*
[12/23/17, 8:06:05 PM] Suyash: Today Udit?

[12/23/17, 10:04:54 PM] Udit: So you guys can start early
[12/23/17, 10:09:38 PM] Suyash: Ah no rush then
[12/23/17, 10:09:42 PM] Suyash: 12 is good too

[12/23/17, 10:51:31 PM] Rahul: These 20 days aren't really holidays for me this time lol
[12/23/17, 10:51:47 PM] Rahul: Man when I want to play they make some plans
[12/23/17, 11:01:15 PM] Suyash: Woah are you using two phones lol
[12/23/17, 11:01:32 PM] Suyash: Just decline your parents and come to play üòÇ
[12/23/17, 11:07:28 PM] Udit: Ya man cm for a bit
[12/23/17, 11:07:39 PM] Udit: So we can play doubles at least
[12/23/17, 11:08:10 PM] Rahul: Yeah two phones
[12/23/17, 11:08:20 PM] Rahul: Not my parents man they are telling me to go
[12/23/17, 11:08:31 PM] Rahul: These people will start throwing shade
[12/23/17, 11:09:06 PM] Rahul: Suddenly they will go from taking a "short flight" to Dubai to coming "aaaaaalll the way from India"
[12/23/17, 11:09:15 PM] Rahul: And I would be seen as disrespecting them
[12/23/17, 11:11:42 PM] Suyash: Ahh ffs
[12/23/17, 11:12:15 PM] Suyash: What relatives are these
[12/23/17, 11:12:23 PM] Akshay: Stop it lol rahul just leave
[12/23/17, 11:12:52 PM] Udit: Akshay u cming?

[12/23/17, 11:14:56 PM] Rahul: My aunt
[12/23/17, 11:15:01 PM] Rahul: Mostly it's just her lol
[12/23/17, 11:15:21 PM] Suyash: It's okay, disrespect her
[12/23/17, 11:15:47 PM] Rahul: No man not worth it
[12/23/17, 11:15:49 PM] Akshay: Sound advice rahul.
[12/23/17, 11:16:04 PM] Akshay: Dude it's your holiday
[12/23/17, 11:16:18 PM] Akshay: Firstly, how is it disrespectful if you go to play for 2 hrs
[12/23/17, 11:16:28 PM] Akshay: Which logic says that idk
[12/23/17, 11:16:32 PM] Rahul: While they planned something else?
[12/23/17, 11:16:37 PM] Rahul: You have no idea dude
[12/23/17, 11:16:44 PM] Rahul: Worthy of capital punishment
[12/23/17, 11:16:48 PM] Akshay: They planned later right?
[12/23/17, 11:17:20 PM] Rahul: Leaving in 15 minutes
[12/23/17, 11:18:24 PM] Rahul: Sorry, but let's play in the summer
[12/23/17, 11:19:19 PM] Rahul: lol I'm being melodramatic - if they do this again I'll politely tell them I need to get the fuck out of here without them
[12/23/17, 11:20:15 PM] Suyash: Ah what are you gonna do at DM?
[12/23/17, 11:21:24 PM] Rahul: Walk around and look for sweaters and then eat ice cream
[12/23/17, 11:21:35 PM] Rahul: And then eat something else and come back
[12/23/17, 11:21:40 PM] Suyash: Enjoy üòÇ
[12/23/17, 11:21:48 PM] Rahul: Apparently they feel 20 degrees is very cold
[12/23/17, 11:21:55 PM] Udit: Bro I'll buy u ice cream from mc Donald
[12/23/17, 11:21:57 PM] Akshay: Dude but they created the plan after you joined the plan to play
[12/23/17, 11:22:01 PM] Suyash: My mom says to buy stuff now, because VAT is coming
[12/23/17, 11:22:32 PM] Rahul: Boi udit u in DM?
[12/23/17, 11:22:39 PM] Rahul: Yeah 5 percent
[12/23/17, 11:22:42 PM] Rahul: Annoying
[12/23/17, 11:22:52 PM] Rahul: As of it's not already marked up
[12/23/17, 11:22:59 PM] Udit: No just reached home
[12/23/17, 11:23:06 PM] Rahul: But their plan, Akshay, overrides mine
[12/23/17, 11:25:06 PM] Suyash: So Udit we're still on for 12?
[12/23/17, 11:25:11 PM] Suyash: I'll leave soon
[12/23/17, 11:25:25 PM] Udit: Ya ajinkya is also cming
[12/23/17, 11:26:20 PM] Suyash: üëç
[12/23/17, 11:26:56 PM] Suyash: It would've been solid with 4, doubles
[12/23/17, 11:28:08 PM] Rahul: Sorry
[12/23/17, 11:28:15 PM] Rahul: You guys have fun tho
[12/23/17, 11:35:08 PM] Akshay: Is Sunil not going?
[12/23/17, 11:36:22 PM] Suyash: üëé
[12/24/17, 12:06:42 AM] Suyash: Udit come down
[12/24/17, 12:07:38 AM] Udit: Omw
[12/24/17, 2:19:37 AM] Suyash: Given the scores of each player in a game of squash rounders (full point) is there a way to tell how many points you've won against every opponent? You are also given who is serving and receiving at that point. Assume 3 ppl
[12/24/17, 2:20:00 AM] Suyash: If it's impossible, what info do you need to achieve a deterministic solution?
[12/24/17, 2:20:33 AM] Suyash: ^something I was thinking about, dk the answer
[12/24/17, 2:47:44 AM] Akshay: I don't think there is a deterministic solution without assuming a fixed probability of each player beating another
[12/24/17, 2:48:13 AM] Akshay: Then you can use Markov chains probably, and there might be a Monte carlo simulation that gives you an answer
[12/24/17, 2:48:32 AM] Akshay: But for a particular game, without actually counting the head to head, I doubt you can
[12/24/17, 2:48:44 AM] Akshay: Because there is no fixed pattern, it can be random who beats whom
[12/24/17, 3:59:51 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
[12/24/17, 4:00:29 AM] Rahul: Woah tha fuck srry didn't mean to send that
[12/24/17, 4:06:34 AM] Rahul: Man one of my regrets
[12/24/17, 4:07:07 AM] Rahul: Forgot programming one month after the class finished - Monte Carlo sim and stuff
[12/24/17, 7:11:02 AM] Akshay: Damn
[12/25/17, 9:32:22 AM] Suyash: You guys wanna play tomorrow morning?
[12/25/17, 8:51:30 PM] Udit: Hey guys is squash on?
[12/25/17, 9:21:51 PM] Akshay: I can't come
[12/25/17, 9:36:56 PM] Udit: Ah.. suyash?
[12/26/17, 1:09:36 AM] Rahul: 5?
[12/26/17, 1:09:57 AM] Rahul: Today they are going to buy furniture, gardening stuff I am not going
[12/26/17, 1:26:03 AM] Suyash: Sorry I'm going out, can't make it today
[12/26/17, 1:27:08 AM] Udit: No worries I already played my share üòÅüòÅ
[12/27/17, 2:23:16 AM] Rahul: Squash today?
[12/27/17, 2:47:00 AM] Suyash: Yes udit was saying around 5 PM
[12/27/17, 3:26:05 AM] Udit: Yup
[12/27/17, 3:40:30 AM] Rahul: Yah I'll come plans for the day done
[12/27/17, 3:43:03 AM] Rahul: Udit's house?
[12/27/17, 3:47:16 AM] Suyash: Yes
[12/27/17, 4:48:26 AM] Rahul: Confirmed?
[12/27/17, 4:48:32 AM] Rahul: I'm about to leave
[12/27/17, 4:48:53 AM] Suyash: Yup I'll leave now too
[12/27/17, 4:49:10 AM] Udit: üëåüëå
[12/27/17, 5:15:31 AM] Suyash: Come down Udit
[12/27/17, 5:15:53 AM] Udit: Omw
[12/27/17, 8:29:00 AM] Akshay: Couldn't come sorry. Was at the doctor's place when you guys formed the plan. I got home at 5:45, then thought it would be late to join
[12/29/17, 12:01:53 AM] Akshay: Yo, Sunil, rahul, dw about your money, I'll return it when we meet
[12/29/17, 12:01:57 AM] Akshay: For squash
[12/29/17, 2:40:04 AM] Sunil: Alright no worries
[12/29/17, 2:59:56 AM] Sunil: What are you guys doing these days?
[12/29/17, 4:03:12 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/29/17, 4:04:21 AM] Suyash: Lolol
[12/29/17, 4:04:32 AM] Suyash: Akshay got rekt
[12/29/17, 4:04:35 AM] Akshay: Lol all this is fishy
[12/29/17, 4:04:54 AM] Akshay: Since last week, they've been saying andy Murray hasn't recovered properly, won't play aussie et al
[12/29/17, 4:05:02 AM] Suyash: If you knew Murray is playing, you would've gone for sure yea
[12/29/17, 4:05:04 AM] Akshay: And Djokovic is "rearing to go, healthy" etc
[12/29/17, 4:05:12 AM] Akshay: Now this sudden switch
[12/29/17, 4:05:53 AM] Akshay: Which follows news from day before yesterday that Andy Murray was taking a short stopover in abu Dhabi en route to Melbourne, to practice in the heat, maybe because good players are here etc
[12/29/17, 4:06:16 AM] Akshay: They probably knew Djokovic can't play and would have to replace him, but avoided saying this earlier
[12/29/17, 4:06:25 AM] Akshay: Because of the tickets, branding etc
[12/29/17, 4:06:36 AM] Akshay: People probably wanted to see Djokovic too
[12/29/17, 4:06:40 AM] Suyash: The match is an exhibition, 1 set only
[12/29/17, 4:06:46 AM] Akshay: Not at the price lol
[12/29/17, 4:06:55 AM] Akshay: Yes
[12/29/17, 4:07:03 AM] Akshay: But still
[12/29/17, 4:07:06 AM] Akshay: It's all weird
[12/29/17, 4:07:15 AM] Akshay: Why would Andy Murray else stop in abu dhabi
[12/29/17, 4:11:04 AM] Suyash: Yup
[12/29/17, 4:11:15 AM] Suyash: Tournament total fail
[12/29/17, 4:12:38 AM] Akshay: Absolute
[12/30/17, 6:03:25 AM] Akshay: What plans for new year celebrations?
[12/30/17, 7:19:31 AM] Akshay: I can probably play sometime tomorrow morning, after 11
[12/30/17, 7:19:45 AM] Akshay: Probably. But can any of you?
[12/30/17, 7:50:34 AM] Udit: Ya I don't mind morning
[12/30/17, 8:06:43 AM] Akshay: Have you guys been playing a lot?
[12/30/17, 11:15:14 AM] Suyash: I can play too
[12/30/17, 11:15:39 AM] Suyash: Not more than what's evident in this chat
[12/30/17, 11:45:04 AM] Sunil: Well I've been playing some table tennis but haven't played any squash since last week
[12/30/17, 9:31:45 PM] Udit: When u boys cming?
[12/30/17, 9:50:45 PM] Akshay: 12? That's best for me.
[12/30/17, 10:22:02 PM] Akshay: Sunil, rahul, I'll bring your money
[12/30/17, 10:23:19 PM] Suyash: A bit earlier ~ 11:30 is also good - what do y'all prefer
[12/30/17, 10:25:31 PM] Udit: Ya I don't mind either
[12/30/17, 10:25:50 PM] Akshay: https://www.rt.com/usa/414640-nigerian-prince-arrested-louisiana/amp/
[12/30/17, 10:26:11 PM] Akshay: Lol, have lost count of the number of emails this guy has sent me haha
[12/30/17, 10:29:34 PM] Udit: Srsly?
[12/30/17, 10:32:34 PM] Akshay: Yes, have you seen the Prince of Nigeria scam emails
[12/30/17, 10:32:42 PM] Suyash: Looks like Udit is not familiar üòÇ
[12/30/17, 10:32:49 PM] Akshay: I get them quite often if I look in my spam
[12/30/17, 10:32:58 PM] Akshay: They very rarely make it to my inbox
[12/30/17, 10:34:21 PM] Suyash: Yup
[12/30/17, 10:35:00 PM] Suyash: Don't think they're coming today
[12/30/17, 10:39:48 PM] Akshay: They haven't responded yet, hmm
[12/30/17, 10:39:51 PM] Akshay: Let's see
[12/30/17, 10:40:15 PM] Akshay: Lol, if we don't meet mutually, I can't give the money back
[12/30/17, 10:40:22 PM] Suyash: So Akshay can you come at 11:30, instead of 12
[12/30/17, 10:40:25 PM] Suyash: Yup haha
[12/30/17, 10:40:29 PM] Akshay: I guess it's mine to keepüòÅ
[12/30/17, 10:40:35 PM] Suyash: They have to show up now :")
[12/30/17, 10:40:46 PM] Akshay: I'll try, but 12 is better. You guys can start
[12/30/17, 10:41:15 PM] Akshay: I'll come as soon as I can
[12/30/17, 10:41:23 PM] Suyash: üëå
[12/30/17, 10:54:56 PM] Akshay: Can you guys come to my place?
[12/30/17, 10:55:01 PM] Akshay: For a change
[12/30/17, 10:55:12 PM] Akshay: So that I don't have to always comeüòÇ
[12/30/17, 10:55:21 PM] Akshay: But also, a nice court here
[12/30/17, 11:02:54 PM] Suyash: Ah if it were closer to a station
[12/30/17, 11:03:05 PM] Suyash: I'll probably get lost walking
[12/30/17, 11:03:23 PM] Akshay: No, it's fairly simple to walk from the station
[12/30/17, 11:03:30 PM] Akshay: A straight line, follow the road
[12/30/17, 11:03:40 PM] Suyash: It's much further than Udits tho
[12/30/17, 11:03:45 PM] Akshay: Then turn at the school
[12/30/17, 11:03:53 PM] Akshay: Gems Winchester
[12/30/17, 11:04:26 PM] Suyash: Ahh
[12/30/17, 11:05:46 PM] Suyash: I think Udits building mates also coming
[12/30/17, 11:07:18 PM] Udit: Ajinkya is
[12/30/17, 11:07:30 PM] Udit: I mean I can drive to ur place
[12/30/17, 11:07:35 PM] Udit: Will be a change
[12/30/17, 11:08:27 PM] Akshay: It's free 12-2
[12/30/17, 11:09:04 PM] Akshay: Let me know
[12/30/17, 11:09:18 PM] Suyash: Udit if you're driving, can you pick me up from the metro station
[12/30/17, 11:10:31 PM] Akshay: Suyash man, it's not that bad a walk either
[12/30/17, 11:10:38 PM] Akshay: There are buses from metro too
[12/30/17, 11:10:42 PM] Akshay: C18
[12/30/17, 11:10:51 PM] Akshay: Get off at American hospital stop
[12/30/17, 11:10:58 PM] Akshay: Just opposite my building
[12/30/17, 11:11:30 PM] Akshay: It's sort of similar to rahul's house for you, except the metro switch
[12/30/17, 11:11:56 PM] Akshay: Or X25, get off at wafi city stop, which is also close
[12/30/17, 11:14:53 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/30/17, 11:14:53 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/30/17, 11:14:54 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[12/30/17, 11:23:20 PM] Akshay: If you get lost, just look for American hospital or movenpick as landmarks. Movenpick is just 2 buildings away
[12/30/17, 11:23:52 PM] Suyash: I shall wait for Udits reply :")
[12/30/17, 11:24:04 PM] Akshay: Ok
[12/30/17, 11:24:27 PM] Akshay: But come soon
[12/30/17, 11:24:57 PM] Akshay: 12-2 it's free, Idk after that
[12/30/17, 11:26:53 PM] Akshay: Also, udit's best driving route here will not pass via the metro station, according to me
[12/30/17, 11:27:22 PM] Akshay: The frequency of buses is very good, why are you averse
[12/30/17, 11:28:21 PM] Suyash: The bus is every 15 minutes
[12/30/17, 11:28:29 PM] Suyash: Acc to your screenshot
[12/30/17, 11:29:02 PM] Suyash: Why bus when you can car, it'll be much faster
[12/30/17, 11:29:32 PM] Suyash: And Udits place would be much easier in the first place
[12/30/17, 11:41:28 PM] Akshay: But there are more buses, not just that one
[12/30/17, 11:41:48 PM] Akshay: F18,C18, X25 all come close enough to allow a brief walk
[12/30/17, 11:42:15 PM] Udit: Bro suyash i can pick u up from smwhere
[12/30/17, 11:42:27 PM] Udit: A metro station near his house?
[12/30/17, 11:42:45 PM] Akshay: I know, you've told me that a lot, the point is that the reverse obviously holds true for me. Occasionally, you can come, just like going to rahul's house
[12/30/17, 11:43:09 PM] Akshay: Plus it's a nice chance to try using my building's court, see if we like it or not
[12/30/17, 11:43:29 PM] Udit: U never played there?
[12/30/17, 11:43:43 PM] Akshay: No
[12/30/17, 11:43:58 PM] Akshay: My parents moved here only after I left in August
[12/30/17, 11:44:07 PM] Udit: Oh ya
[12/30/17, 11:44:11 PM] Akshay: So I basically saw this place only 2 weeks agoüòÇ
[12/30/17, 11:44:26 PM] Udit: Bro if we r cming to ur place I shld leave now
[12/30/17, 11:44:35 PM] Akshay: Yeah, ofc
[12/30/17, 11:44:42 PM] Udit: Suyash?
[12/30/17, 11:44:58 PM] Akshay: I think he left
[12/30/17, 11:45:26 PM] Udit: I am leaving now
[12/30/17, 11:45:38 PM] Udit: And is it fine if ajinkya joins?
[12/30/17, 11:45:51 PM] Akshay: Yeah yeah
[12/30/17, 11:46:00 PM] Udit: Cool see u in bit
[12/30/17, 11:46:00 PM] Akshay: You already mentioned above
[12/30/17, 11:46:20 PM] Udit: Yeah well that was for my building
[12/30/17, 11:46:31 PM] Udit: Ur building ur rules
[12/30/17, 11:48:07 PM] Akshay: Woah I'm in charge uh?
[12/30/17, 11:59:27 PM] Suyash: Yo Udit
[12/30/17, 11:59:45 PM] Suyash: I'll be at oud metha station in 2 mins
[12/30/17, 11:59:48 PM] Suyash: Are you around?
[12/30/17, 11:59:54 PM] Suyash: Lol text and drive
[12/31/17, 12:02:42 AM] Akshay: You can look for buses C18,F18,X25. For the first two, get off at American hospital. X25 get off at wafi city
[12/31/17, 12:03:12 AM] Akshay: But be careful with X25, if you miss the stop it will take you to silicon oasis
[12/31/17, 12:03:18 AM] Suyash: Udit shall indeed pick me up
[12/31/17, 12:04:04 AM] Suyash: He's 5 mins away
[12/31/17, 12:04:16 AM] Akshay: Wafi city stop is next to this white building called allianze francais something
[12/31/17, 12:05:18 AM] Akshay: Ok, that's good. Tbh the buses aren't bad either so it's just the initial laziness for you to use themüòÇ
[12/31/17, 12:05:36 AM] Akshay: I have discovered convenient ways to get as close to home as possible
[12/31/17, 12:06:12 AM] Akshay: Lol why did Sunil not even respond , probably still asleep
[12/31/17, 12:16:12 AM] Akshay: Are you guys here
[12/31/17, 12:48:02 PM] Sunil: <‚ÄéGIF omitted>
[12/31/17, 1:08:20 PM] Suyash: Happy New Year lads
[12/31/17, 2:07:32 PM] Akshay: Happy New Year! Have a great 2018!
[1/1/18, 1:47:11 AM] Udit: Happy New year guys
[1/1/18, 1:47:29 AM] Udit: U guys free to play squash anytime today?
[1/1/18, 1:49:02 AM] Sunil: Nope going out today
[1/1/18, 1:57:12 AM] Udit: Actually nvm that
[1/1/18, 1:57:30 AM] Udit: I will be going out today as well
[1/1/18, 2:10:35 AM] Rahul: Did you know that the earth actually only completed its revolution around the sun at roughly noon today
[1/1/18, 2:12:00 AM] Rahul: So by revolution (not calendar), new year started at noon today
[1/1/18, 2:21:42 AM] Akshay: Hmm
[1/1/18, 2:22:04 AM] Akshay: But that's accounted for with the leap year counting right?
[1/1/18, 2:22:15 AM] Akshay: Basically what happens is as rahul says
[1/1/18, 2:22:45 AM] Akshay: But for convenience an extra day is just added once every four years to make the count match the revs
[1/1/18, 2:35:34 AM] Suyash: yes I think ^ is true
[1/1/18, 3:28:08 AM] Rahul: Yeah that's why they do leap year - because the earth does 1 revolution in roughly 365.25 days
[1/1/18, 9:21:12 PM] Suyash: Play today?
[1/1/18, 10:12:59 PM] Udit: I am busy after 2
[1/1/18, 10:13:16 PM] Udit: So we can play b4 that
[1/1/18, 10:48:09 PM] Suyash: üëç
[1/1/18, 10:49:21 PM] Suyash: What about @17133041968 @971563515145 @14692792607 ?
[1/1/18, 10:55:00 PM] Rahul: I think I can come before 2
[1/1/18, 10:59:00 PM] Udit: I need to leave at 130
[1/1/18, 11:00:12 PM] Rahul: Depends - I'm dropping fam at airport
[1/1/18, 11:00:31 PM] Udit: U r?
[1/1/18, 11:01:12 PM] Rahul: Like leaving rn
[1/1/18, 11:01:36 PM] Rahul: Leaving at 1:30 means we should start playing at 12 max
[1/1/18, 11:01:41 PM] Rahul: Your house?
[1/1/18, 11:01:45 PM] Udit: Ya
[1/1/18, 11:02:04 PM] Rahul: I'll see I may be there by 12:30 or something
[1/1/18, 11:02:13 PM] Udit: Suyash? Akshay? Sunil?
[1/1/18, 11:03:27 PM] Suyash: I can come at 12
[1/1/18, 11:03:38 PM] Suyash: Udit it's okay if we continue playing after you leave right
[1/1/18, 11:03:49 PM] Suyash: Also call Ajinkya, Dylan
[1/1/18, 11:06:32 PM] Udit: Ya ya
[1/1/18, 11:06:48 PM] Udit: I think ajinkya will cm
[1/2/18, 1:24:57 AM] Akshay: Sorry, I received the messages but had gone out, couldn't reply
[1/2/18, 1:25:12 AM] Akshay: My grandparents came here yesterday, will be here for a month
[1/2/18, 2:15:36 AM] Suyash: Nice
[1/2/18, 10:17:47 AM] Sunil: Hey do you guys want to go for a movie maybe tmrw or day after ?
[1/2/18, 8:59:07 PM] Rahul: Which movie?
[1/2/18, 9:15:37 PM] Suyash: I don't think any good new movies are out
[1/2/18, 9:16:31 PM] Suyash: Also today is likely the last opp to play at Udits - he's leaving tomorrow
[1/2/18, 9:16:39 PM] Suyash: Are you guys free?
[1/2/18, 9:22:10 PM] Rahul: I'm free early - maybe 11 to 1 or so
[1/2/18, 9:56:43 PM] Udit: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/2/18, 9:57:02 PM] Udit: üòÇ
[1/2/18, 9:57:32 PM] Udit: Vat on insurance? Wtf
[1/2/18, 10:48:36 PM] Udit: So u guys cming today?
[1/2/18, 11:27:41 PM] Rahul: The fuck
[1/2/18, 11:27:52 PM] Rahul: Where's the value added in insurance lol
[1/2/18, 11:28:04 PM] Rahul: I can come preferably early
[1/2/18, 11:31:18 PM] Rahul: Akshay, sunil are you free?
[1/2/18, 11:33:57 PM] Suyash: I can come
[1/2/18, 11:34:08 PM] Suyash: But it'll be better if we had more people
[1/2/18, 11:35:47 PM] Suyash: One thing I don't get about VAT is that some shops are increasing prices to make up for losses in profit on their own VAT in the supply chain
[1/2/18, 11:37:02 PM] Suyash: According to ICSE Math, the 5% you're charged at the end is solely to make up for those losses - put the entire burden on the customer
[1/2/18, 11:38:19 PM] Suyash: So that excuse is total BS, the sorta stuff that's become quite common even in Gulf News and the like these days
[1/2/18, 11:39:32 PM] Udit: Ajinkya will be cming
[1/2/18, 11:39:44 PM] Udit: I am not able to contact akshay
[1/2/18, 11:40:37 PM] Suyash: Yup what time is good for you?
[1/2/18, 11:41:23 PM] Udit: Anytime after 12
[1/2/18, 11:56:08 PM] Udit: Just msg when u guys leave
[1/2/18, 11:56:40 PM] Akshay: I can't come today
[1/2/18, 11:57:38 PM] Udit: Ah üôÅ
[1/2/18, 11:57:59 PM] Udit: Well we won't be able to meet then
[1/2/18, 11:58:19 PM] Suyash: Damn
[1/2/18, 11:58:26 PM] Akshay: What time though
[1/2/18, 11:58:26 PM] Akshay: I'll see
[1/2/18, 11:58:45 PM] Suyash: I talked to Rahul, we're pretty much free all day
[1/2/18, 11:59:17 PM] Suyash: Whenever can have more ppl, since this is likely the last time in ~ 8 months
[1/2/18, 11:59:21 PM] Akshay: Maybe I can do 3
[1/2/18, 11:59:29 PM] Akshay: Will see
[1/2/18, 11:59:38 PM] Akshay: I'm also very tired, just had tennis
[1/3/18, 12:00:51 AM] Suyash: Okay
[1/3/18, 12:03:27 AM] Suyash: Fine so let's play at 3?
[1/3/18, 12:03:35 AM] Suyash: Udit, Rahul is this time okay for y'all?
[1/3/18, 12:03:48 AM] Akshay: I'm not even sure of 3, said I'll check
[1/3/18, 12:04:04 AM] Suyash: Akshay come if you want to, np
[1/3/18, 12:50:58 AM] Udit: Well then u guys can cm early and akshay will join us later?
[1/3/18, 12:53:41 AM] Udit: Or screw it 3 is fine actually
[1/3/18, 1:40:03 AM] Akshay: I can't come today
[1/3/18, 1:40:13 AM] Akshay: Will be going out at 4
[1/3/18, 1:40:23 AM] Akshay: Sorry udit. We'll meet in summer
[1/3/18, 1:50:15 AM] Udit: Ahh np then
[1/3/18, 1:51:43 AM] Akshay: We've actually managed to play more than I thought, considering its a short break !
[1/3/18, 1:52:01 AM] Akshay: I could have come twice more if not for my knee as well
[1/3/18, 2:27:20 AM] Suyash: Still on for 3 right?
[1/3/18, 2:36:27 AM] Rahul: Yeah I'll come
[1/3/18, 2:57:00 AM] Udit: üëå
[1/3/18, 7:21:52 AM] Suyash: I think I played the blonde haired dude back in Grade 10 at a tournament
[1/3/18, 7:22:28 AM] Udit: Whoa Srsly
[1/3/18, 7:22:35 AM] Udit: Did u win?
[1/3/18, 7:22:56 AM] Suyash: Ofc not :") Score was 15-11, 15-7 I think
[1/3/18, 7:23:15 AM] Udit: Bro that's  gr8
[1/3/18, 7:23:17 AM] Suyash: That guy can probably beat Dylan lol
[1/3/18, 7:23:27 AM] Udit: Hmm
[1/3/18, 7:25:55 AM] Rahul: Maybe but Dylan honestly doesn't take us seriously
[1/3/18, 7:26:08 AM] Rahul: I don't think we have ever seen him try to play
[1/3/18, 7:26:38 AM] Rahul: Those dudes were insane though
[1/3/18, 7:29:14 AM] Suyash: Yeah they were hitting it way harder than we can
[1/3/18, 7:29:30 AM] Suyash: But the best aspect was their fitness and retrieval technique
[1/3/18, 7:29:40 AM] Suyash: Here the point ends with a decent drop
[1/3/18, 7:30:14 AM] Suyash: True
[1/3/18, 7:41:59 AM] Akshay: Who is it
[1/3/18, 7:44:51 AM] Udit: They were playing with 1 dot
[1/3/18, 7:47:07 AM] Suyash: Ah I didn't notice that
[1/3/18, 7:47:27 AM] Suyash: This guy is Egyptian, the other 2 probably Indian
[1/3/18, 7:48:56 AM] Udit: Couple of guys playing  in the other court
[1/3/18, 7:49:11 AM] Udit: Really good
[1/3/18, 7:57:40 AM] Akshay: Nice
[1/5/18, 4:21:02 AM] Rahul: Play tomorrow afternoon?
[1/5/18, 4:21:36 AM] Rahul: After that I won't be back for 5 months üò•
[1/5/18, 4:21:53 AM] Rahul: Actually .. 6
[1/5/18, 4:30:35 AM] Suyash: Yup I won't be seeing y'all until next December
[1/5/18, 7:57:07 AM] Sunil: Do you guys just want to hang out in some mall instead?
[1/5/18, 9:42:56 AM] Udit: Next dec? Wtf
[1/5/18, 10:17:40 AM] Akshay: He's doing internship in the US
[1/5/18, 10:37:35 AM] Sunil: Damn, so did you already get the internship?
[1/5/18, 10:37:52 AM] Akshay: Yes, he did
[1/5/18, 11:11:33 AM] Udit: That's gr8 man
[1/5/18, 11:48:11 AM] Suyash: Yup, I mean this December 2018 lol
[1/5/18, 11:19:29 PM] Rahul: Will you be back in September?
[1/6/18, 12:02:35 AM] Suyash: Yes, that's after y'all have started
[1/6/18, 4:14:32 AM] Suyash: You guys are flying out tonight right?
[1/6/18, 5:07:33 AM] Rahul: Yeah pretty much - I'm going 2:30 AM. Akshay said 5 AM I think
[1/6/18, 5:13:03 AM] Sunil: Safe trip guys
[1/6/18, 5:23:57 AM] Akshay: I'm leaving home at 5, flight at 8
[1/6/18, 5:24:00 AM] Akshay: Thanks Sunil
[1/6/18, 5:24:24 AM] Akshay: Same to you, and rahul, suyash. Suyash you leaving Monday?
[1/6/18, 5:28:31 AM] Rahul: Thanks guys
[1/6/18, 5:28:53 AM] Rahul: Let‚Äôs finish this mofo semester and internship and be back before we know it üòÉ
[1/6/18, 5:30:44 AM] Udit: Have a safe trip guys
[1/6/18, 5:38:27 AM] Suyash: Have a good one guys üëç
[1/6/18, 10:03:08 AM] Akshay: Rahul says this every single time before a semesterüòÇ
[1/6/18, 10:03:35 AM] Rahul: Yeah on purpose
[1/6/18, 10:03:36 AM] Akshay: Good luck for exams udit
[1/6/18, 10:04:00 AM] Akshay: Sunil has a whole week left to chill, that's cool
[1/6/18, 10:05:27 AM] Suyash: Lol good to be pumped for uni like that haha
[1/6/18, 10:38:00 AM] Sunil: Haha true that
[1/6/18, 4:59:52 PM] Akshay: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/01/06/blizzard-snarls-air-traffic-at-jfk-as-2-planes-collide-and-hundreds-of-flights-are-delayed.html
[1/6/18, 5:00:11 PM] Akshay: Hope rahul's flight can land safely, I think he is flying to NYC
[1/7/18, 5:59:36 AM] Udit: Thanks man
[1/7/18, 11:27:55 AM] Rahul: Yeah the flight after mine got delayed - my plane couldn‚Äôt park for 45 minutes because all the gates were full - no planes leaving
[1/7/18, 11:31:46 AM] Rahul: It took me 2 hours to get my bag - thought I wasn‚Äôt going to make connecting flight at la guardia
[1/7/18, 5:43:10 PM] Akshay: I'm back at uni in my dorm lads
[1/7/18, 5:43:31 PM] Akshay: Did you fly Dubai to la guardia or jfk?
[1/7/18, 5:51:19 PM] Akshay: http://www.nydailynews.com/amp/new-york/fliers-throw-punches-riot-delay-plagued-jfk-airport-article-1.3741443
[1/7/18, 5:51:24 PM] Akshay: Damn rahul was it this bad?
[1/7/18, 5:51:35 PM] Akshay: Lucky your flight landed and you got your bags
[1/7/18, 9:47:44 PM] Rahul: Dubai to JFK, taxi to la guardia, then Columbus
[1/8/18, 1:48:16 AM] Akshay: Lol I'm awake since 2:30 am
[1/8/18, 1:48:37 AM] Akshay: It's not jet lag I think just very bad timing, slept at 8 pm
[1/9/18, 7:12:11 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/9/18, 7:12:19 AM] Akshay: Lol look at this ledge
[1/9/18, 7:14:13 AM] Udit: Lol
[1/9/18, 7:48:24 AM] Sunil: Omg üòÇ
[1/12/18, 4:27:43 AM] Rahul: Are you guys able to Skype with your parents?
[1/12/18, 4:28:44 AM] Rahul: I'm using this app called BOTIM for now, but it's inconvenient because it only works on phone or tablet
[1/12/18, 4:29:36 AM] Udit: I was using that too but it is kinda shit
[1/12/18, 6:20:09 AM] Suyash: I have been doing phone calls only
[1/12/18, 6:20:33 AM] Suyash: Skype should work with VPN, but it'll be hard to explain my parents how to use it!
[1/12/18, 6:20:50 AM] Akshay: It is now 0 degrees in Houston
[1/12/18, 6:20:58 AM] Akshay: Huge cold front since last might
[1/12/18, 6:21:17 AM] Akshay: Funny thing is that the hydrology professor yesterday morning said exactly this would happen
[1/12/18, 6:22:00 AM] Akshay: And everyone looked at the weather on their phone, said the lowest indicated by the weather was 7 Celsius or whatever. He said "the weather is wrong!"
[1/12/18, 8:32:04 AM] Suyash: Woah epic
[1/12/18, 8:32:09 AM] Suyash: How did he know that?
[1/12/18, 8:56:12 AM] Akshay: He is the director of something called the SPEED centre at Rice. Pretty famous around these parts
[1/12/18, 8:56:14 AM] Akshay: Google it
[1/12/18, 8:56:32 AM] Akshay: I guess he has access to the live computing technology that is making some of these measurements
[1/12/18, 8:56:45 AM] Akshay: He doesn't need to believe what a weather app will tell him lol
[1/12/18, 10:12:00 AM] Suyash: Yup
[1/12/18, 10:12:16 AM] Suyash: Is hydrology related to Ceve or an elective?
[1/12/18, 10:12:36 AM] Akshay: It's within ceve, like a focus area or track
[1/12/18, 10:12:50 AM] Akshay: This class is an in-major electove
[1/12/18, 10:13:14 AM] Akshay: But most ceve do it, because we have to do 2 hydrology classes atleast. And this is the one that teaches basics
[1/12/18, 10:13:49 AM] Suyash: Nice
[1/12/18, 10:16:23 AM] Akshay: How was your first week
[1/12/18, 10:16:40 AM] Akshay: Lol Sunil must be pissed, only 2 days left in dubai
[1/12/18, 10:19:33 AM] Suyash: It's been quite good
[1/12/18, 10:19:51 AM] Suyash: Discrete Math is finally a math course that's relevant and interesting to CS
[1/12/18, 10:20:46 AM] Suyash: Operating Systems course is very extensive, a lot of work though. But pretty important material
[1/12/18, 10:22:28 AM] Sunil: Lol yeah üòÇ
[1/12/18, 10:22:55 AM] Sunil: I'm traveling tmrw night actually
[1/12/18, 3:14:47 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/12/18, 3:28:12 PM] Akshay: Yesterday same thing in Houston
[1/12/18, 3:28:23 PM] Akshay: From 16 to 0 at night
[1/12/18, 4:03:13 PM] Rahul: Bakwas this US weather
[1/12/18, 4:04:38 PM] Rahul: Discrete math like Fourier analysis and stuff?
[1/12/18, 4:11:27 PM] Akshay: I think discrete math is stuff like Boolean algebra, binary operations, F2 vector space etc?
[1/12/18, 4:16:10 PM] Suyash: Right now we've only done induction, sets, functions. But it eventually gets into CS topics like graphs and trees.
[1/12/18, 4:16:55 PM] Akshay: Ah
[1/13/18, 10:32:02 AM] Akshay: Shit this might be a bit late, but rahul, Sunil, if either of you need Mechanics of Materials by Craig, don't buy I have the pdf
[1/13/18, 10:32:24 AM] Akshay: Or Linear Algebra by David Clay
[1/13/18, 10:35:51 AM] Rahul: Lol I have hibbeler
[1/13/18, 10:36:08 AM] Rahul: Linear also some other book
[1/13/18, 10:36:25 AM] Rahul: I have Mariam and Craig for dynamics
[1/13/18, 10:39:00 AM] Sunil: I have the same one lol
[1/13/18, 10:39:18 AM] Sunil: For linear I used otto bretscher last sem
[1/13/18, 10:41:55 AM] Akshay: Are you all doing statics/dynamics this term?
[1/13/18, 10:42:00 AM] Akshay: That's for rigid bodies I mean
[1/13/18, 10:42:21 AM] Akshay: Rice has stat and dyn in one course together (shitty, don't learn it properly)
[1/13/18, 10:42:43 AM] Akshay: But now I'm taking the next class, called solid mechanics, which is for non-rigid bodies
[1/13/18, 10:43:04 AM] Akshay: You guys may have done it already as part of statics and dynamics?
[1/13/18, 10:43:26 AM] Akshay: Do you want me to send the book as ref
[1/13/18, 10:43:37 AM] Akshay: I have an older version of meriam and kraige if you need
[1/13/18, 10:43:44 AM] Sunil: For me it's separate
[1/13/18, 10:43:52 AM] Sunil: This semester I'm taking solid mechanics
[1/13/18, 10:44:17 AM] Akshay: Ok
[1/13/18, 10:44:20 AM] Sunil: As well as dynamics
[1/13/18, 10:44:25 AM] Akshay: Ahh
[1/13/18, 10:44:42 AM] Akshay: It'll be fun, solid mech
[1/13/18, 10:44:48 AM] Akshay: It's a fundamental class
[1/13/18, 10:44:52 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[1/13/18, 10:44:58 AM] Akshay: Have to know it if you want to be an engineer of any type lol
[1/13/18, 10:45:04 AM] Sunil: True
[1/13/18, 10:46:55 AM] Suyash: Even I had that for lin alg
[1/13/18, 10:48:38 AM] Sunil: Didn't like that tb lol
[1/13/18, 10:49:13 AM] Sunil: Found it a bit too much theory, not many examples
[1/13/18, 10:49:21 AM] Suyash: Yeah they barely taught anything
[1/13/18, 10:49:27 AM] Suyash: Left as an exercise for the reader
[1/13/18, 10:49:32 AM] Sunil: Yeah
[1/13/18, 10:51:58 AM] Rahul: I have dynamics, mechanics of materials (which I think is what you guys are calling solid mechanics), numerical methods for engineers and design for engineers
[1/13/18, 10:52:52 AM] Rahul: As in not the CAD design stuff from first year but actually drawing, cutting using heavy tools, circuits with arduino etc
[1/13/18, 10:53:23 AM] Rahul: Then I have linear, diff we and engineering Econ
[1/13/18, 10:54:41 AM] Rahul: Did statics last semester
[1/13/18, 10:57:50 AM] Sunil: I have very similar stuff as you Rahul
[1/13/18, 10:57:58 AM] Sunil: Had statics last semester as well
[1/13/18, 10:59:08 AM] Rahul: Lol Sunil, I think you and me will not diverge till the eighth semester
[1/13/18, 10:59:41 AM] Rahul: I‚Äôll stay one extra semester to complete two more technical electives
[1/13/18, 11:06:33 AM] Sunil: Yeah üòÇ
[1/13/18, 11:07:56 AM] Akshay: You guys seem to have a much more sophisticated core engineering education
[1/13/18, 11:08:17 AM] Akshay: At rice all of the design stuff is in a separate set of courses or department called ENGI
[1/13/18, 11:08:37 AM] Akshay: That people of the engineering majors don't HAVE to take, but usually will
[1/13/18, 11:08:50 AM] Akshay: But I also feel none of those is well aligned to civil eng üò¢
[1/13/18, 11:09:17 AM] Akshay: I might want to take some classes in architecture maybe. But it's said to be really hard
[1/13/18, 11:10:56 AM] Akshay: Also most of them are closed to people who haven't taken arch 101- and you don't want to take that unless it's your major, ppl say you will basically spend 15 hrs a week in the studio
[1/13/18, 11:21:07 AM] Rahul: Dam boi
[1/14/18, 12:14:09 AM] Udit: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[1/14/18, 5:40:59 AM] Rahul: ü§£
[1/15/18, 7:18:21 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/15/18, 7:35:22 PM] Rahul: Your sister
[1/15/18, 7:38:13 PM] Akshay: No
[1/15/18, 7:38:18 PM] Rahul: Sorry
[1/15/18, 7:38:23 PM] Rahul: Was just guessing
[1/15/18, 7:38:32 PM] Akshay: Ok no worries
[1/15/18, 7:39:04 PM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[1/15/18, 7:39:19 PM] Sunil: Is it you Akshay?
[1/15/18, 7:39:26 PM] Akshay: Yup haha
[1/15/18, 7:39:34 PM] Akshay: Rahul overthinking stuff as always
[1/15/18, 7:39:40 PM] Akshay: Is me
[1/15/18, 7:40:25 PM] Sunil: Yep as always
[1/15/18, 7:40:37 PM] Rahul: I thought the way the question was phrased, the answer was supposed to be surprising
[1/15/18, 7:41:11 PM] Rahul: Or maybe I was just kidding lol
[1/15/18, 7:41:16 PM] Akshay: That's why we agreed that you were overthinking.
[1/15/18, 7:42:34 PM] Akshay: Wawrinka has taken set 1 in his first match against berankis
[1/15/18, 7:42:47 PM] Akshay: Has a big scar on his knees where the surgery was I guess
[1/15/18, 7:42:51 PM] Akshay: Knee*
[1/15/18, 7:42:57 PM] Akshay: Playing decent
[1/16/18, 6:20:59 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/16/18, 6:30:26 AM] Akshay: Take care
[1/16/18, 6:30:32 AM] Akshay: Looks what's happened here
[1/16/18, 6:30:46 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/16/18, 6:31:01 AM] Akshay: And the lowest temp predicted is -5 Celsius
[1/16/18, 6:31:07 AM] Akshay: Which isn't that bad
[1/16/18, 6:31:18 AM] Akshay: The worry seems to be mainly about ice formation on roads
[1/16/18, 6:31:23 AM] Akshay: Some highways are closed
[1/16/18, 6:31:41 AM] Akshay: Maybe texan roads and vehicles aren't designed to deal with it
[1/16/18, 7:34:51 AM] Suyash: Damn
[1/16/18, 7:35:44 AM] Suyash: Here it went up to 30 past weekend
[1/17/18, 6:41:07 AM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/17/18, 7:18:12 AM] Rahul: Boiii
[1/17/18, 7:18:17 AM] Rahul: Where sunglasses
[1/17/18, 7:45:27 AM] Akshay: Why?
[1/17/18, 7:45:32 AM] Akshay: Because of the Sun?
[1/17/18, 7:45:40 AM] Akshay: Lol Ofc but why particularly
[1/17/18, 8:22:28 AM] Rahul: Very bright, especially with previous days' snow
[1/17/18, 6:43:12 PM] Suyash: Thiem tanking again
[1/17/18, 6:58:38 PM] Akshay: He just got third set
[1/17/18, 9:03:14 PM] Akshay: Monfils!
[1/18/18, 7:38:57 AM] Suyash: Ffs Goffin
[1/18/18, 7:39:29 AM] Suyash: Ffs Wawrinka
[1/18/18, 8:46:16 AM] Akshay: Yup crazy. Wawrinka maybe expected. Goffin a shock. Especially against benneteau
[1/18/18, 10:59:43 AM] Suyash: I thought benneteau retired lol
[1/18/18, 11:10:04 AM] Akshay: Me too
[1/19/18, 6:55:23 AM] Akshay: Did you all know the US government might shut down today
[1/19/18, 6:55:32 AM] Akshay: Some sort of legislative stalemate or something
[1/19/18, 6:58:24 AM] Sunil: Damn I didn't know that
[1/19/18, 7:14:54 AM] Rahul: They‚Äôre hitting the debt ceiling
[1/19/18, 7:15:16 AM] Rahul: Not helped by the new tax bill
[1/19/18, 7:16:45 AM] Akshay: Ok rahul is more technical about it haha, let's ask him
[1/19/18, 7:16:56 AM] Akshay: What exactly is the problem though
[1/19/18, 7:17:08 AM] Akshay: Is it like they aren't getting a majority vote
[1/19/18, 7:17:42 AM] Rahul: They want to pass a bill to approve more government spending
[1/19/18, 7:18:14 AM] Akshay: Ah
[1/19/18, 7:18:26 AM] Rahul: The democrats are threatening to oppose it in the senate over fights over other policies
[1/19/18, 7:18:32 AM] Rahul: Example DACA
[1/19/18, 7:18:36 AM] Akshay: And the democrats are holding it up, because they haven't supported DACA
[1/19/18, 7:18:43 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[1/19/18, 7:19:26 AM] Rahul: It passed the house but the senate is divided 51-49 only and I don‚Äôt think a spending bill is passed by simple majority
[1/19/18, 7:19:46 AM] Akshay: Yup has to be a bigger difference
[1/19/18, 7:20:27 AM] Rahul: Ok lol, linear algebra now assumes more importance, bye
[1/19/18, 7:20:37 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 7:24:20 AM] Akshay: Yup,bye I have lin al at 1
[1/19/18, 1:06:26 PM] Udit: Whoa u guys hv blackboard?
[1/19/18, 1:18:01 PM] Akshay: Some of my classes do as well
[1/19/18, 1:18:06 PM] Akshay: Especially the older buildings
[1/19/18, 1:18:16 PM] Akshay: Uni profs don't seem to mind it at all
[1/19/18, 1:24:31 PM] Sunil: Same here
[1/19/18, 1:55:28 PM] Rahul: Yeah - they ask the profs before scheduling for preferences
[1/19/18, 1:55:59 PM] Rahul: If someone wants a big projector or skateboard they'll try to accommodate
[1/19/18, 1:56:40 PM] Rahul: Most profs don't seem to care so the smaller classes scheduled in older buildings usually get blackboards
[1/19/18, 2:31:00 PM] Akshay: Wow didn't know Ohio state profs used skateboards to move around in class :")
[1/19/18, 4:26:54 PM] Rahul: *smartboard
[1/19/18, 4:27:08 PM] Rahul: Although there are some quirky profs out there
[1/19/18, 4:27:11 PM] Akshay: Yup haha
[1/19/18, 4:27:29 PM] Rahul: Who knows there probably is a professor who skateboards to classes :‚Äù)
[1/19/18, 4:27:33 PM] Akshay: Which business classes are you doing this term
[1/19/18, 4:27:45 PM] Rahul: None for IBE this semester
[1/19/18, 4:28:02 PM] Rahul: Only engineering economics - which is a requirement for engineers anyway
[1/19/18, 4:28:12 PM] Akshay: Ahh ok
[1/19/18, 4:28:16 PM] Rahul: Next business classes next semester
[1/19/18, 4:28:30 PM] Akshay: We have eng economics too within civil eng but it's not a requirement
[1/19/18, 4:28:44 PM] Akshay: I'll try to take some econ in the last two years let's see
[1/19/18, 4:28:56 PM] Rahul: Take macro as ge
[1/19/18, 4:29:20 PM] Akshay: Would like to. But first need to do compulsory econ 100 (basic) for that
[1/19/18, 4:29:29 PM] Akshay: They don't give a waiver for AP
[1/19/18, 4:29:53 PM] Akshay: And the thought of doing basic econ again is boring especially when it eats up 3 credits
[1/19/18, 5:02:25 PM] Rahul: Dam that shitty
[1/19/18, 5:02:34 PM] Rahul: Is there no option to test out of it
[1/19/18, 5:02:45 PM] Rahul: Like do a test to prove you know the stuff
[1/19/18, 5:06:50 PM] Akshay: No haha
[1/19/18, 7:11:54 PM] Akshay: Paes and raja beat Murray soares
[1/19/18, 7:11:54 PM] Akshay: Amazing
[1/19/18, 7:11:55 PM] Akshay: Let's goooooooooooo
[1/19/18, 7:11:55 PM] Akshay: Purav raja was amazing
[1/19/18, 7:11:55 PM] Akshay: He must have been so nervous. Second serve facing match point
[1/19/18, 7:11:56 PM] Akshay: He saved it
[1/19/18, 7:11:56 PM] Akshay: Then set up his own match point
[1/19/18, 7:11:57 PM] Akshay: Then amazing return to win it
[1/19/18, 7:11:58 PM] Akshay: It was all him
[1/19/18, 7:11:58 PM] Akshay: Leander was just watching
[1/19/18, 7:11:58 PM] Akshay: Haha the Aussie commentators are pronouncing his name as RAHA as if he was Spanish
[1/19/18, 7:11:59 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/19/18, 7:12:11 PM] Akshay: Fuck brilliant. First time I have seen Indians not choke in tennis lol
[1/19/18, 7:12:58 PM] Akshay: Lol amazing excitement. Delayed me doing my hydrology hw
[1/19/18, 7:36:50 PM] Suyash: Woah epic
[1/19/18, 7:47:35 PM] Suyash: A crazy women's match going on too, 13-12 in the third
[1/19/18, 7:47:52 PM] Akshay: I think it's the best women's match I ever have seen
[1/19/18, 7:47:56 PM] Akshay: Have ever*
[1/19/18, 7:48:18 PM] Suyash: Yeah I've never seen a women's match cross 6-6
[1/20/18, 8:58:40 PM] Akshay: Oh no Paes/Raja got demolished 1-6,2-6
[1/20/18, 8:58:41 PM] Akshay: Sigh
[1/20/18, 8:58:41 PM] Akshay: At least one moment in the sun for some Indians in a non cricket sport
[1/20/18, 8:59:14 PM] Suyash: Damn
[1/21/18, 5:12:59 AM] Udit: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[1/21/18, 5:13:01 AM] Udit: It's snowing in Manchester wtf
[1/21/18, 5:14:12 AM] Akshay: Damn, stay warm. Street looks nice though.
[1/25/18, 7:00:51 PM] Akshay: Happy Republic day
[1/25/18, 8:05:14 PM] Sunil: Happy Republic day!
[1/25/18, 8:06:26 PM] Suyash: Jai Hind
[1/25/18, 8:06:34 PM] Suyash: üáÆüá≥
[1/26/18, 3:12:48 AM] Udit: Happy republic day guys
[1/26/18, 3:13:04 AM] Udit: Exams finally got over!!
[1/26/18, 4:46:26 AM] Akshay: That's good
[1/26/18, 7:57:23 PM] Akshay: How's the semester lads
[1/26/18, 7:57:33 PM] Akshay: Barely 3 weeks done and today I'm feeling so bored
[1/26/18, 8:19:04 PM] Sunil: It's been decent so far
[1/26/18, 9:29:18 PM] Akshay: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/27/18, 6:16:35 AM] Akshay: Lol wozniacki is finally a slam champion, so one more quiz question is erased- Danish player who got to world number 1 without a slam titleüòÇ
[1/27/18, 8:08:15 AM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[1/28/18, 9:10:31 AM] Akshay: Happy Birthday udit! I just remembered sorry
[1/28/18, 9:11:05 AM] Sunil: Happy birthday Udit!
[1/28/18, 9:12:30 AM] Udit: Thanks guys
[1/28/18, 9:55:48 AM] Rahul: Happy birthday Udit
[1/28/18, 10:10:18 AM] Suyash: Have a good one Udit
[1/28/18, 10:16:27 AM] Rahul: Somber day on this group except for Udit‚Äôs birthday :‚Äù)
[1/28/18, 10:17:05 AM] Akshay: Yeah I mean cilic lost, so suyash and I are basically mourning
[1/28/18, 10:17:16 AM] Akshay: Plus ofc, the rigour of hw is just killing me
[1/28/18, 10:17:30 AM] Suyash: Sunil is a Fedtard right
[1/28/18, 10:17:45 AM] Akshay: As staunch as they come
[1/28/18, 10:17:48 AM] Rahul: Woah ease off
[1/28/18, 10:18:01 AM] Suyash: Rahul also a Fedtard?
[1/28/18, 10:18:06 AM] Rahul: Yup
[1/28/18, 10:18:20 AM] Akshay: Rahul a fedtard because he dislikes other players mostly
[1/28/18, 10:18:28 AM] Akshay: Not because he is amazed by Fed
[1/28/18, 10:18:33 AM] Akshay: Imo, from what he says
[1/28/18, 10:18:44 AM] Rahul: No I am amazed by fed
[1/28/18, 10:18:59 AM] Rahul: It‚Äôs just that I will support anyone against Murray
[1/28/18, 10:19:19 AM] Rahul: That‚Äôs where ur misconception arises from, I‚Äôm guessing
[1/28/18, 10:19:47 AM] Rahul: I will support zverev/thiem against fed
[1/28/18, 10:20:16 AM] Akshay: For me, my rule is pretty simple-in the atp matches, I support the underdog or Andy Murray. At slams, the decisions to support players in individual matches is calculated using predictions-such as, which of these players is more likely to beat Nadal or Fed in the next round et al...
[1/28/18, 10:20:30 AM] Suyash: I will support even Murray vs. Fed
[1/28/18, 10:20:49 AM] Akshay: For me, Murray vs Fed is probably the strongest contrast
[1/28/18, 10:20:57 AM] Akshay: Because Murray is Murray and he is the underdog
[1/28/18, 10:21:11 AM] Akshay: So it qualifies under both aspects of my homemade rule
[1/28/18, 10:53:48 AM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/28/18, 10:54:04 AM] Akshay: Woah Sunil on snapchat!
[1/28/18, 10:54:11 AM] Akshay: What will your mother say Sunil
[1/28/18, 10:54:21 AM] Akshay: Please focus on studies..m
[1/28/18, 10:54:24 AM] Akshay: üòÇ
[1/28/18, 10:55:06 AM] Akshay: Sunil is a true fedtard though
[1/28/18, 10:55:21 AM] Akshay: Have to acknowledge him, he supported Fed even when Novak was rolling over him
[1/28/18, 11:29:36 AM] Udit: Thanks  man
[1/28/18, 3:37:55 PM] Akshay: https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-europe-42851668
[1/28/18, 3:38:03 PM] Akshay: Like the steve jobs of furniture
[1/28/18, 4:12:28 PM] Suyash: Definitely
[1/28/18, 4:12:40 PM] Suyash: I've heard he's had a rough tax history
[1/28/18, 4:13:49 PM] Akshay: Also linked to fascism...
[1/28/18, 5:43:53 PM] Suyash: Woah
[1/29/18, 8:29:43 AM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[1/29/18, 8:46:53 AM] Rahul: Didn‚Äôt know fedtardness was actually a thing till I decided to look it up lol
[1/29/18, 8:47:06 AM] Rahul: It‚Äôs actually pretty funny
[1/29/18, 9:02:27 AM] Akshay: It's insane
[1/29/18, 1:00:58 PM] Rahul: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/4/18, 6:57:49 PM] Suyash: Super Bowl really exciting
[2/4/18, 7:40:13 PM] Akshay: Lol I'm just reading about an upset that occurred! I was watching a bit in the common room but couldn't follow what was going on
[2/4/18, 7:40:44 PM] Suyash: Underdogs won
[2/5/18, 1:22:20 AM] Rahul: That sack boi
[2/5/18, 1:22:26 AM] Rahul: 2 mins left
[2/5/18, 11:35:36 AM] Akshay: https://www.theplayerstribune.com/harry-kane-tottenham-zero-to-100/amp/
[2/5/18, 11:35:37 AM] Akshay: Epic
[2/9/18, 5:48:55 PM] Suyash: <‚Äéimage omitted>
[2/9/18, 6:01:16 PM] Akshay: That's insane
[2/9/18, 6:05:02 PM] Suyash: Yup there was no crowd at all, these guys just walking
[2/9/18, 6:05:15 PM] Suyash: A team called LA FC played them at UCLA
[2/9/18, 6:05:25 PM] Suyash: Because their stadium is under construction
[2/10/18, 8:10:28 AM] Akshay: Ahh lucky
[2/14/18, 10:21:34 PM] Suyash: Hey guys, what service do y'all use to call your parents?
[2/14/18, 10:21:39 PM] Suyash: Does the Etisalat VOIP thing work?
[2/14/18, 10:40:00 PM] Akshay: BOTIM
[2/14/18, 10:40:02 PM] Akshay: Yes.
[2/14/18, 10:40:12 PM] Akshay: I've felt it much clearer than skype
[2/14/18, 10:40:21 PM] Akshay: It doesn't buffer, get cut etc much
[2/14/18, 10:47:02 PM] Suyash: Nice
[2/14/18, 10:47:26 PM] Suyash: I had managed to have my parents use a UCLA VPN software, on my account
[2/14/18, 10:47:28 PM] Akshay: But again I've only had about 5 conversations using it
[2/14/18, 10:47:34 PM] Suyash: Skype worked great
[2/14/18, 10:47:42 PM] Akshay: üëåüèæ
[2/14/18, 10:48:00 PM] Suyash: Unfortunately the IT ppl were able to track it, and apparently its not legal for me to share my credentials - not even with parents lol
[2/14/18, 10:48:11 PM] Suyash: So now need to find an alternative
[2/14/18, 10:48:23 PM] Akshay: Ah
[2/14/18, 10:49:22 PM] Akshay: This seems good
[2/14/18, 10:49:26 PM] Suyash: I tried my best to absolve myself - gave a high tech explanation
[2/14/18, 10:49:29 PM] Akshay: Idk how expensive it is
[2/14/18, 10:49:37 PM] Suyash: But the IT guy was a step ahead surprisingly
[2/14/18, 10:49:42 PM] Suyash: Yup thanks üëç
[2/14/18, 10:49:48 PM] Akshay: What did you say
[2/14/18, 10:50:08 PM] Suyash: Said I'm using a remote desktop to initiate a connection, hence I'm always in control etc
[2/14/18, 10:50:29 PM] Akshay: Ok
[2/14/18, 10:50:31 PM] Akshay: Then
[2/14/18, 10:50:42 PM] Suyash: But they were able to track the fact that no remote connection was started from me here, before the usual connection from Dubai!
[2/14/18, 10:50:47 PM] Suyash: Lol there is no privacy
[2/14/18, 10:50:56 PM] Akshay: Woah
[2/14/18, 10:51:03 PM] Akshay: Then did he called you out for lying
[2/14/18, 10:51:07 PM] Akshay: Call
[2/14/18, 10:51:23 PM] Suyash: No I told him the honest fact before he could,
[2/14/18, 10:51:41 PM] Suyash: Now he's like he'll try to figure out an alternative solution
[2/14/18, 10:51:50 PM] Akshay: Ok
[2/14/18, 10:51:53 PM] Suyash: But sharing the VPN is definitely not an option.
[2/14/18, 10:51:59 PM] Akshay: Hmm
[2/14/18, 10:52:02 PM] Suyash: So parents like should we buy Etisalat package
[2/14/18, 10:52:12 PM] Suyash: Fking UAE
[2/14/18, 10:52:30 PM] Suyash: Lol I might get my Visa revoked for saying that :")
[2/14/18, 10:52:34 PM] Akshay: Lol there is probably someone in UAE and US reading that message now!
[2/14/18, 10:52:48 PM] Suyash: WhatsApp is supposed to be encrypted, but who knows
[2/14/18, 10:53:05 PM] Akshay: Mate it's definitely accessible imo. Idk about this stuff
[2/14/18, 10:53:17 PM] Akshay: But no country would permit it if it wasn't trackable
[2/14/18, 10:53:24 PM] Suyash: Ah good point
[2/14/18, 10:53:27 PM] Akshay: Esp UAE, bans most stuff
[2/14/18, 10:54:10 PM] Suyash: The obvious restrictions feel stronger now that we've experienced a different country
[2/14/18, 10:54:23 PM] Suyash: Etisalat, Du are BS
[2/14/18, 10:54:38 PM] Suyash: Ripping off possibly the worst treated sections of society
[2/14/18, 10:54:45 PM] Suyash: Not us ofc
[2/14/18, 10:54:56 PM] Suyash: But other workers etc who used it to call their family
[2/14/18, 10:55:20 PM] Suyash: There is a website for petitions called change.org
[2/14/18, 10:55:27 PM] Suyash: Someone started one to repeal the ban
[2/14/18, 10:55:33 PM] Akshay: Yes-but those guys are the ones that find a way, even better than we can
[2/14/18, 10:55:35 PM] Suyash: Lol Etisalat banned change.org itself
[2/14/18, 10:55:46 PM] Suyash: Ah definitely
[2/14/18, 10:56:07 PM] Akshay: That's insane haha epic. Their authority is absolute.
[2/14/18, 10:56:39 PM] Suyash: Before Skype was popular, they used to sell calling cards in small Karama, Satwa shops
[2/14/18, 10:56:51 PM] Akshay: They still do
[2/14/18, 10:56:55 PM] Suyash: Took Etisalat years to release their own
[2/14/18, 10:56:58 PM] Suyash: Yup
[2/14/18, 10:57:08 PM] Akshay: We used to get one to talk to grandparents. Much cheaper
[2/14/18, 10:57:21 PM] Suyash: Same
[2/14/18, 10:58:11 PM] Akshay: Does imo work
[2/14/18, 10:58:36 PM] Suyash: What is that?
[2/14/18, 10:59:09 PM] Akshay: It's another service similar to Skype right
[2/14/18, 10:59:19 PM] Suyash: Never used it
[2/14/18, 10:59:25 PM] Akshay: Me neither
[2/14/18, 10:59:26 PM] Suyash: That's what Etisalat is peddling right?
[2/14/18, 10:59:38 PM] Akshay: No, that is BOTIM
[2/14/18, 10:59:42 PM] Suyash: Ah my bad, I think I know what you're talking about
[2/14/18, 10:59:50 PM] Suyash: Most probably that's banned too
[2/14/18, 11:00:36 PM] Akshay: Alright
[2/14/18, 11:00:37 PM] Akshay: Goodnight
[2/14/18, 11:00:51 PM] Akshay: Lol rahul too busy to chat I guess
[2/14/18, 11:01:04 PM] Suyash: Bye
[2/14/18, 11:01:05 PM] Akshay: Maybe the business is linked to Valentine's day :") jk
[2/14/18, 11:01:14 PM] Suyash: Lol I thought the same
[2/16/18, 10:50:57 AM] Rahul: Woah ok no
[2/16/18, 10:51:23 AM] Rahul: I went to sleep at 12 to wake up at 4 to study for a midterm
[2/16/18, 10:51:28 AM] Rahul: Completely screwed up lol
[2/16/18, 10:51:42 AM] Rahul: I think the last time I actually didn‚Äôt know how to solve a problem was ISC
[2/16/18, 10:52:02 AM] Rahul: If I get 80 I‚Äôll be üòÉ
[2/16/18, 10:55:44 AM] Akshay: Ahh that's tough
[2/16/18, 10:56:35 AM] Rahul: Man so bad
[2/16/18, 10:56:56 AM] Rahul: Anyway, gotta get over it
[2/16/18, 10:58:46 AM] Rahul: Lol just noticed on my feed, Kosovo declared independence 10 years ago this week
[2/16/18, 10:58:58 AM] Rahul: *dudnt mean to write lol
[2/16/18, 10:59:01 AM] Rahul: *didnt
[2/16/18, 10:59:12 AM] Rahul: Interesting stuff
[2/16/18, 10:59:24 AM] Rahul: I don‚Äôt know much about Eastern Europe
[2/16/18, 11:01:19 AM] Akshay: Ok
[2/16/18, 11:04:44 AM] Suyash: Still remember in Grade 10, before Geo exam Rahul was gonna wake up at 3 to study ‚Ä¶ only to realize that exam has been cancelled :")
[2/16/18, 11:05:27 AM] Suyash: I am on a bus to Tree Hacks rn; just realized I forgot my pouch which had tooth brush, cream etc x_x
[2/16/18, 11:09:27 AM] Akshay: Yup
[2/16/18, 11:09:34 AM] Akshay: Good luck
[2/16/18, 11:32:05 AM] Rahul: Tree hacks?
[2/16/18, 11:33:37 AM] Rahul: Ahh I see good luck
[2/16/18, 11:33:42 AM] Rahul: How does it work?
[2/16/18, 11:34:10 AM] Rahul: Will you be working on stuff in random teams once you get there or go with ideas and try to make something?
[2/16/18, 11:35:03 AM] Rahul: Boi that day was like the best of my 10th grade life
[2/16/18, 11:35:36 AM] Rahul: Ofc I never studied for that geo exam and got 59/80 anyway
[2/16/18, 11:36:09 AM] Suyash: Both
[2/16/18, 11:36:20 AM] Suyash: Lol the make up exam was too good
[2/16/18, 11:36:42 AM] Suyash: I think Sukri was the invigilator üòâ
[2/16/18, 11:37:04 AM] Suyash: That was his name right? I'm forgetting stuff about middle school especially
[2/16/18, 11:37:13 AM] Rahul: And I remember my map ended up looking pretttttty similar to yours üòú
[2/16/18, 11:37:22 AM] Rahul: Yeah that was his name
[2/16/18, 11:37:26 AM] Suyash: Hahaha yes
[2/16/18, 11:37:49 AM] Rahul: Dude shit old memories coming back
[2/16/18, 11:38:15 AM] Rahul: I hate feeling nostalgic
[2/16/18, 11:38:27 AM] Suyash: Ahh yup
[2/16/18, 11:38:44 AM] Suyash: I think grade 8-10 was the most memorable
[2/16/18, 11:38:59 AM] Rahul: Yeah
[2/16/18, 11:39:05 AM] Suyash: Even 11-12, but that's more recent stuff
[2/16/18, 11:39:18 AM] Rahul: 11-12 I hated
[2/16/18, 11:39:30 AM] Rahul: Worst years of my life
[2/16/18, 11:39:45 AM] Rahul: *worst synonymous with most useless
[2/16/18, 11:40:12 AM] Suyash: Yup tbh it was a lot of not fun, BS stuff/work
[2/16/18, 11:40:23 AM] Rahul: Have u applied for CPT?
[2/16/18, 11:40:51 AM] Suyash: No, I'll do it in ~ April
[2/16/18, 11:41:00 AM] Rahul: Ah ok
[2/16/18, 11:41:04 AM] Suyash: It's a rip off tbh
[2/16/18, 11:41:21 AM] Suyash: Need to enroll into a summer course, which will cost 500$ at least
[2/16/18, 11:41:30 AM] Suyash: Plus other fees I'm sure will be taken
[2/16/18, 11:41:43 AM] Rahul: Yeah it‚Äôs what we ‚Äòaliens‚Äô get lol
[2/16/18, 11:42:12 AM] Suyash: What is your plan for the summer?
[2/16/18, 11:42:29 AM] Rahul: Even the most free countries in the world, founded on immigration aren‚Äôt as open as they seem when you‚Äôre first thinking of studying there
[2/16/18, 11:42:49 AM] Rahul: For now internship here
[2/16/18, 11:42:53 AM] Rahul: In US
[2/16/18, 11:43:25 AM] Suyash: I expect it is tad worse in public unis like ours
[2/16/18, 11:43:31 AM] Rahul: Will know for sure mid March - ish
[2/16/18, 11:43:46 AM] Suyash: Nice, I think you need to show a confirmation letter to apply for CPT
[2/16/18, 11:43:55 AM] Suyash: Have you been applying/interviewing?
[2/16/18, 11:43:55 AM] Rahul: Yeah I know
[2/16/18, 11:45:01 AM] Rahul: Yeah a few engineering internships - but best case is i get into Deloitte
[2/16/18, 11:45:24 AM] Rahul: Proving the connection to my major will be the hardest thing then though
[2/16/18, 11:45:25 AM] Suyash: Great
[2/16/18, 11:46:00 AM] Suyash: Lol try to get something in Nor Cal, we can play squash, TT, tennis etc :")
[2/16/18, 11:46:47 AM] Rahul: Haha yeah
[2/16/18, 11:47:21 AM] Rahul: Party, beach, good weather would be awesome
[2/16/18, 11:47:56 AM] Suyash: Weather is good, still not as good as LA, even East Coast
[2/16/18, 11:48:28 AM] Suyash: Beach, surfing etc is actually over hyped here - the Pacific Ocean is too cold
[2/16/18, 11:48:38 AM] Rahul: Oh shit
[2/16/18, 11:48:58 AM] Rahul: Nvm then - squash, tennis would be awesome
[2/16/18, 11:49:09 AM] Suyash: Yup
[2/16/18, 11:49:19 AM] Rahul: Bruh I was pumped yesterday
[2/16/18, 11:49:26 AM] Suyash: For?
[2/16/18, 11:49:45 AM] Rahul: We had a machining preoject - 6 people over 7 weeks machine pistons by hand to run an air motor
[2/16/18, 11:50:03 AM] Suyash: Wow sounds exciting
[2/16/18, 11:50:16 AM] Rahul: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[2/16/18, 11:50:27 AM] Rahul: *groups of 6
[2/16/18, 11:50:49 AM] Rahul: Dam fun tho to actually machine the stuff then just design it in Solidworks
[2/16/18, 11:50:53 AM] Suyash: Ah I'll open the video when on WiFi :")
[2/16/18, 11:51:02 AM] Suyash: Yup definitely
[2/16/18, 11:51:18 AM] Suyash: Is this related to the ISS project you talked about in winter?
[2/16/18, 11:51:25 AM] Rahul: No no
[2/16/18, 11:51:47 AM] Rahul: This is a course every ME takes at OSU
[2/16/18, 11:52:19 AM] Suyash: Right
[2/16/18, 11:52:19 AM] Rahul: They created it specifically to address deficiencies in graduating engineers‚Äô ability to talk to machinists
[2/16/18, 11:52:26 AM] Suyash: Lol
[2/16/18, 11:53:10 AM] Rahul: Dam it felt good when that thing ran
[2/16/18, 11:53:28 AM] Rahul: Bought cookies for all the tas and instructors üòÄ
[2/16/18, 11:53:39 AM] Suyash: Nice :)
[2/16/18, 11:56:30 AM] Rahul: If u get BOTIM, we can chat some time
[2/16/18, 11:56:39 AM] Rahul: Lol told Akshay this last month, forgot
[2/16/18, 11:57:40 AM] Suyash: Lol we can just use WhatsApp/Facetime/Skype here
[2/16/18, 12:22:30 PM] Rahul: Yeah true lol
[2/16/18, 12:22:39 PM] Rahul: FaceTime
[2/16/18, 12:22:48 PM] Rahul: I deleted Skype because it was useless to me
[2/16/18, 12:23:06 PM] Rahul: Only used to to Skype my parents
[2/16/18, 12:23:29 PM] Rahul: Dud have you heard of what‚Äôs happening at the new Apple headquarters
[2/16/18, 12:23:58 PM] Rahul: People keep walking into the glass while looking at their phones
[2/16/18, 5:17:43 PM] Rahul: Lol I told my dad ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even get how to do one of the questions‚Äù - I think he thought that I git all of them wrong
[2/16/18, 9:13:55 PM] Akshay: Oh haha
[2/16/18, 9:14:07 PM] Akshay: He's probably not surprised though
[2/17/18, 6:43:14 AM] Rahul: Wow Akshay you‚Äôre so funny
[2/17/18, 8:15:47 AM] Akshay: Yup. I've developed an acute sense of humour.
[2/20/18, 4:30:34 AM] Udit: Hey guys!
[2/20/18, 4:30:41 AM] Udit: Happy birthday suyash!
[2/20/18, 4:30:49 AM] Udit: Hope u have a great one man!
[2/20/18, 4:32:24 AM] Rahul: Happy birthday Suyash!
[2/20/18, 4:39:51 AM] Sunil: Happy birthday Suyash üéÇüéâ
[2/20/18, 5:04:58 AM] Akshay: Happy birthday buddy, have a great year
[2/20/18, 7:16:27 AM] Rahul: Seems like the early morning celebrations have turned into a hangover üòú
[2/20/18, 7:47:39 AM] Akshay: Lolol definitely
[2/20/18, 9:12:56 AM] Suyash: Thanks guys!
[2/20/18, 9:26:47 AM] Udit: Party hard man!
[2/20/18, 9:29:57 AM] Rahul: Party‚Äôs over I‚Äôm guessing
[2/20/18, 9:30:02 AM] Rahul: The after party starts now
[2/20/18, 9:41:13 AM] Suyash: Lol the party day before lasted too long... The effect being I missed my class today :) Good start
[2/20/18, 9:41:21 AM] Suyash: Did y'all have long weekend this time?
[2/20/18, 9:41:54 AM] Suyash: Also, if y'all are free - we can catch up on video chat sometime today
[2/20/18, 9:57:51 AM] Akshay: I actually did not have long weekend. Had class.
[2/20/18, 9:59:47 AM] Rahul: Yeah no long weekend
[2/21/18, 8:50:25 PM] Akshay: Does sometime this weekend work for you all to Skype/group chat/abuse each other üòÇ
[2/21/18, 8:50:36 PM] Akshay: Jk
[2/21/18, 11:19:05 PM] Suyash: Yup I'm down
[2/22/18, 8:10:47 AM] Udit: Ya let's do it
[2/22/18, 8:42:43 AM] Rahul: üëçüèΩ
[2/22/18, 8:50:55 AM] Sunil: Okay üëç
[2/22/18, 8:54:21 AM] Rahul: Sunil!
[2/22/18, 8:54:29 AM] Rahul: You replied
[2/22/18, 8:59:52 AM] Akshay: Woah
[2/22/18, 9:00:03 AM] Akshay: Sunil is out of the cave.
[2/22/18, 9:02:03 AM] Sunil: Lol üòÇ
[2/22/18, 9:17:31 AM] Suyash: ü§£
[2/22/18, 11:46:15 AM] Suyash: <‚Äévideo omitted>
[2/22/18, 12:00:10 PM] Sunil: Cool üëç
[2/22/18, 12:01:57 PM] Rahul: Dude your activity in this group in the past 36 hours is probably of the order of a million times more than your average activity
[2/22/18, 12:02:44 PM] Rahul: *Activity = messages/hour
[2/22/18, 12:07:23 PM] Sunil: Well I agree, I'll be more active from now
[2/22/18, 12:34:13 PM] Akshay: Well rahul, it's interesting to know how you quantify that given the past activity was virtually zero
[2/22/18, 12:34:19 PM] Akshay: And you're an engineer
[2/22/18, 12:34:32 PM] Akshay: So x~0 is substituted by x=0
[2/22/18, 12:35:00 PM] Akshay: Suyash, if you keep going to tennis court keep an eye out for pete Sampras
[2/22/18, 12:35:06 PM] Akshay: His sister is the women's tennis coach
[2/22/18, 12:35:12 PM] Akshay: And it seems he helps out occasionally
[2/22/18, 12:44:38 PM] Rahul: *average activity in this group - includes the past three messages since 36 hours ago
[2/22/18, 12:45:36 PM] Rahul: Seems we have an engineer who can‚Äôt find averages in our midst
[2/22/18, 12:46:23 PM] Rahul: Or you didn‚Äôt see that I said 1 million ~ 36 hour activity/average activity not /past activity
[2/22/18, 12:48:18 PM] Akshay: Given how many hours this group has run for, the average activity for Sunil is ~0 though. My inability to comprehend English doesn't compromise my mathematical genius. Or my belief in engineering approximations.
[2/22/18, 12:48:36 PM] Akshay: Lol in my first semester I lost a point for "too many decimal places in answer"
[2/22/18, 12:50:29 PM] Akshay: So Sunil's 36 hr activity can be approximated to be infinitely greater than his average activity.
[2/22/18, 12:50:34 PM] Rahul: Boi it‚Äôs calculus - the denominator can tend to zero, but the ratio exists as a real number
[2/22/18, 12:50:50 PM] Akshay: But the limit is what matters
[2/22/18, 12:50:57 PM] Akshay: The limit as den tends to zero
[2/22/18, 12:51:02 PM] Rahul: So in effect what I meant by a million is that the ratio is equal to the number of hours this group has run
[2/22/18, 12:51:28 PM] Rahul: Or actually number of hours/36
[2/22/18, 12:51:37 PM] Akshay: Yes
[2/22/18, 12:51:39 PM] Akshay: But then
[2/22/18, 12:51:48 PM] Akshay: Since number of hours is infinitely large
[2/22/18, 12:52:02 PM] Akshay: The ratio can again be approximated to be infinity. From an engineering standpoint
[2/22/18, 12:52:32 PM] Akshay: Hence, a million is unacceptable as an engineering calculation.
[2/22/18, 12:54:16 PM] Rahul: No... no since number of hours since inception of group is obviously nowhere close to 36 million (can‚Äôt have been more than 18 months of this group - that‚Äôs probably not even a 100000 hours), the ratio is less than presumed but is still a real number
[2/22/18, 12:54:58 PM] Rahul: Hence sunils inactivity is not as bad as originally presumed
[2/22/18, 12:55:39 PM] Akshay: But again
[2/22/18, 12:55:56 PM] Akshay: A data analyst would say that the last 36 hrs has skewed the data
[2/22/18, 12:56:07 PM] Akshay: And hence remove them from the analysis
[2/22/18, 12:56:24 PM] Akshay: Thus again proving that Sunil's activity is still 0üòÉ
[2/22/18, 12:56:27 PM] Rahul: And exclude it from the average lol
[2/22/18, 12:56:52 PM] Akshay: Or you'd have to model it as an extreme value distribution
[2/22/18, 12:57:02 PM] Akshay: Weibull or log Pearson 3
[2/22/18, 12:57:11 PM] Akshay: To get close to an accurate estimate
[2/22/18, 12:57:22 PM] Rahul: But now before making the model  we have to check whether this is a repeating pattern
[2/22/18, 12:57:51 PM] Akshay: Right otherwise you won't have enough data points to reasonably fit the distribution
[2/22/18, 12:58:11 PM] Rahul: Only after waiting for 2 months will we know if he just usually doesn‚Äôt chat or if he chats once in 2 months or so
[2/22/18, 12:58:15 PM] Rahul: Right
[2/22/18, 12:58:17 PM] Akshay: Or even run the KS test or the chi square test
[2/22/18, 12:58:29 PM] Akshay: Hence the appropriate fit cannot be determined
[2/22/18, 12:58:37 PM] Akshay: Thus deeming this problem unsolved
[2/22/18, 12:59:06 PM] Rahul: Lol my stats class didn‚Äôt cover chi squared
[2/22/18, 12:59:12 PM] Akshay: If Sunil's activity =0 is the null hypothesis it cannot be rejected at any meaningful level of significance
[2/22/18, 12:59:37 PM] Akshay: Which means it holds, i.e Sunil is still not active at all in this group.
[2/22/18, 12:59:38 PM] Rahul: We skipped it so she could get to ANOVA in the end
[2/22/18, 12:59:49 PM] Akshay: Ahh we didn't do ANOVA
[2/22/18, 1:00:12 PM] Rahul: Proven until disproven lol you win
[2/22/18, 1:00:44 PM] Akshay: Yup thanks.
[2/22/18, 1:00:57 PM] Akshay: Gracious in defeat.
[2/22/18, 8:12:02 PM] Akshay: https://youtu.be/fn2pc7QFmXQ
[2/22/18, 8:12:09 PM] Akshay: Lol this is the best thing ever
[2/22/18, 8:15:50 PM] Rahul: Dude too epic
[2/22/18, 8:16:08 PM] Rahul: Hanging by the thread at 6-3
[2/22/18, 8:16:15 PM] Rahul: 5 points in a row lol
[2/22/18, 8:17:00 PM] Sunil: Wow that's amazing
[2/22/18, 8:17:23 PM] Sunil: Monfils has always been very unpredictable and exciting to watch
[2/22/18, 8:19:25 PM] Sunil: So is nishikori back or still out injured ?
[2/22/18, 8:20:40 PM] Akshay: Getting back
[2/22/18, 8:20:50 PM] Akshay: Lol Sunil's activity is now steadily increasing
[2/22/18, 8:21:02 PM] Sunil: Lol
[2/22/18, 8:22:03 PM] Sunil: Come on guys, let's not make it so awkward üòÖ
[2/22/18, 8:28:29 PM] Akshay: Lol 2 more messages rahul
[2/22/18, 8:39:22 PM] Rahul: Dude this is an exponential growth rate
[2/22/18, 8:40:17 PM] Rahul: At what point does this disturbance in normality become too prolonged to ignore?
[2/22/18, 8:40:54 PM] Udit: Well it is scientifically proven a person usually tends to do the thing people annoy him about
[2/22/18, 8:42:03 PM] Rahul: Udit getting in on the theory! Merging mathematical and statistical models with scientific reasoning!
[2/22/18, 8:42:21 PM] Rahul: Ok my big world quota for today is over
[2/22/18, 8:42:29 PM] Rahul: *words
[2/22/18, 8:42:33 PM] Udit: Well I used to be good in science
[2/22/18, 8:42:38 PM] Udit: Got a 10 cgpa
[2/22/18, 8:42:41 PM] Udit: üòÅüòÅ
[2/22/18, 8:43:01 PM] Udit: But was dumb enough to choose commerce
[2/22/18, 8:43:06 PM] Udit: So ya..
[2/22/18, 8:43:36 PM] Rahul: Boi u shuda just stuck it to your dad and chosen science
[2/22/18, 8:44:07 PM] Udit: Lol to be honest he never bothered me too much about what to select
[2/22/18, 8:44:15 PM] Udit: He actually himself is an engineer
[2/22/18, 8:44:20 PM] Rahul: Woah
[2/22/18, 8:44:24 PM] Udit: Ya ik
[2/22/18, 8:44:51 PM] Rahul: Dude in school you made it sound like he coerced you into studying commerce to run his business
[2/22/18, 8:45:10 PM] Udit: Ya he kinda does
[2/22/18, 8:45:14 PM] Rahul: Like he threatened to disown you otherwise
[2/22/18, 8:45:25 PM] Udit: Dude.....
[2/22/18, 8:45:28 PM] Udit: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2/22/18, 8:45:31 PM] Udit: Wtf
[2/22/18, 8:46:00 PM] Udit: Like I said I doesn't really matter if u hv a business degree to run a business
[2/22/18, 8:46:14 PM] Udit: It comes gradually with experience
[2/22/18, 8:46:43 PM] Udit: This course the fastens the process
[2/22/18, 8:51:31 PM] Akshay: Udit is incorporating elements of social science theory into an otherwise purely empirical study, namely the data bias introduced by an individual's actions that are promoted on the basis of his psychology.
[2/22/18, 8:52:33 PM] Akshay: In this case, Sunil's sudden affinity to write messages on this group is correlated with (and potentially caused by) our sudden affinity to explore his behaviour on the group.
[2/22/18, 8:52:57 PM] Udit: Yup
[2/22/18, 8:52:59 PM] Akshay: But then this effect on his behaviour can skew our analysis because we want to study his involvement independent of this causation
[2/22/18, 8:53:09 PM] Udit: Another example peer pressure
[2/22/18, 8:53:30 PM] Akshay: So I suggest we introduce instrumental variables to estimate and remove the magnitude of this causal effect.
[2/22/18, 8:53:32 PM] Udit: Well if we want to write a paper then yeah
[2/22/18, 8:54:11 PM] Udit: As in..
[2/22/18, 8:54:38 PM] Akshay: Idk lol you think I know everything?
[2/22/18, 8:55:03 PM] Udit: Well u are the one studying...
[2/22/18, 8:55:14 PM] Udit: And I actually mean just studying
[2/22/18, 8:55:31 PM] Akshay: Sorry to dissapoint.
[2/22/18, 8:55:34 PM] Akshay: Disappoint
[2/22/18, 8:55:39 PM] Udit: Lol
[2/22/18, 8:56:11 PM] Akshay: An engineering way would be to separately collect a dataset of the 'intensity' of our messages analysing Sunil
[2/22/18, 8:56:25 PM] Akshay: And plot that against his behaviour, which is the dependent variable
[2/22/18, 8:56:39 PM] Udit: Well we can eyeball that
[2/22/18, 8:56:46 PM] Udit: Upward moving graph
[2/22/18, 8:57:34 PM] Akshay: The resulting plot can be fit by a distribution with some level of significance. Then the chi square statistic can be used to estimate that effect and then scale our results down by that amount.
[2/22/18, 8:57:59 PM] Akshay: But we still have many unknowns that are affecting our experiment
[2/22/18, 8:58:22 PM] Udit: Yup mood, other engagement the day etc
[2/22/18, 8:58:33 PM] Akshay: Such as a sudden freedom for Sunil (say from dropping a class) or a sudden tendency to look at his phone more (because he is expecting an important message)
[2/22/18, 8:59:00 PM] Akshay: Or something as simple as him no longer muting this group or his notification volume on the phone
[2/22/18, 8:59:59 PM] Udit: Well it's no longer plausible to summarise sunils mood and swings
[2/22/18, 9:00:16 PM] Udit: Depends on more factors than we can comprehend
[2/22/18, 9:00:33 PM] Akshay: Yeah... How does one draw up an exhaustive list of potentially distracting unknowns
[2/22/18, 9:01:00 PM] Akshay: In addition, some of these variables cannot really be estimated in numerical terms
[2/22/18, 9:01:00 PM] Udit: Probably he has found an another more engaging group
[2/22/18, 9:01:20 PM] Udit: It can
[2/22/18, 9:01:20 PM] Akshay: They would have to be substituted with proxy variables that measure them
[2/22/18, 9:01:32 PM] Akshay: But what statistics can be used
[2/22/18, 9:01:45 PM] Akshay: For that enlightening purpose
[2/22/18, 9:01:58 PM] Udit: Or can be simply synthesized all as one variable
[2/22/18, 9:02:05 PM] Akshay: Oh you're right
[2/22/18, 9:02:15 PM] Akshay: Can the correlation matrix be used
[2/22/18, 9:02:19 PM] Udit: And count number of that
[2/22/18, 9:02:20 PM] Udit: Yup
[2/22/18, 9:03:02 PM] Akshay: Maybe the data can be subject to the rosenblatt transform to bring it to a Gaussian distribution
[2/22/18, 9:03:09 PM] Akshay: Which is easiest to work with
[2/22/18, 9:03:46 PM] Akshay: But we still have too little data
[2/22/18, 9:04:00 PM] Udit: And that might be over thinking
[2/22/18, 9:04:02 PM] Akshay: And there is the worry that the subject of testing is put off by the experiment itself
[2/22/18, 9:04:19 PM] Akshay: That is, he stops looking at this chat
[2/22/18, 9:04:30 PM] Akshay: Which negatively skews the data then
[2/22/18, 9:04:36 PM] Akshay: Ffs
[2/22/18, 9:04:57 PM] Udit: Or there can be no correlation and it can just be butterfly effect
[2/22/18, 9:05:18 PM] Udit: I mean there is sm sort relation
[2/22/18, 9:05:20 PM] Akshay: Sunil represents an unsolvable problem, one that will confound elite stat and math university faculty for decades.
[2/22/18, 9:05:22 PM] Akshay: Oh yeah
[2/22/18, 9:05:26 PM] Udit: But nothing direct to prove
[2/22/18, 9:05:40 PM] Akshay: Well include chaos theorists in the discussion too as Udit says
[2/22/18, 9:05:57 PM] Udit: Yup yup
[2/22/18, 9:06:03 PM] Akshay: The US government will start awarding grants to anyone that can generate a solution
[2/22/18, 9:06:43 PM] Udit: Well I dont think it will be too hard to predict a person's next move
[2/22/18, 9:06:50 PM] Udit: In general
[2/22/18, 9:07:19 PM] Udit: It will just need fuck load of data and a millennia to comprehend
[2/22/18, 9:07:43 PM] Udit: Or be good at chess
[2/22/18, 9:08:18 PM] Akshay: Maybe future phd theses will be titled along the lines of 
"An Experimental Method to Evaluate Individual Behaviour in Select Group Chats-Selective Filtering of Causal Variables" - In partial completion of the requirements for a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD.)
[2/22/18, 9:08:56 PM] Udit: I am almost certain that is a topic discussed smwhere
[2/22/18, 9:09:39 PM] Akshay: To what degree of certainty do you refer
[2/22/18, 9:10:07 PM] Udit: Social sciences in Caltech
[2/22/18, 9:10:10 PM] Udit: Idk
[2/22/18, 9:10:21 PM] Akshay: No I meant what amount of certainty
[2/22/18, 9:10:27 PM] Akshay: Like what degree, what level
[2/22/18, 9:10:34 PM] Akshay: No degree as university designation
[2/22/18, 9:10:38 PM] Akshay: Not*
[2/22/18, 9:11:37 PM] Udit: Well not like a complete PhD not the topic but as a mention to it on a discussion point of view
[2/22/18, 9:13:49 PM] Akshay: Ok
[2/22/18, 9:14:02 PM] Akshay: Suyash should also share his academic opinions soon
[2/22/18, 9:14:08 PM] Akshay: Since he is studying CS
[2/22/18, 9:14:33 PM] Akshay: Maybe he can incorporate machine learning, or sensitivity analysis to better solve the issue of Sunil's participation
[2/22/18, 9:14:42 PM] Akshay: Eagerly awaiting his response.
[2/22/18, 9:15:17 PM] Akshay: Alas Sunil cannot contribute to the problem solving, because that again skews the data in the problem itself
[2/22/18, 9:15:55 PM] Sunil: Lol there's literally no reason at all other than the simple fact that I'm not using WhatsApp that much these days
[2/22/18, 9:16:17 PM] Sunil: You guys are honestly just over thinking this entire issue
[2/22/18, 9:21:28 PM] Akshay: Sunil mate you need a gold medal for totally understanding us... Our overthinking was genuinely intended at understanding you üòÇüòú
[2/22/18, 9:21:35 PM] Sunil: It was hilarious how you guys were coming up with all these stats measures and scientific reasoning to explain this thing üòÇ
[2/22/18, 9:22:08 PM] Akshay: Complex problems require ingenuity of mind and rigorous application of knowledge
[2/22/18, 9:22:54 PM] Sunil: I agree but this was never a complex problem to begin with
[2/22/18, 9:23:18 PM] Sunil: It was just blown out of proportion
[2/22/18, 9:23:45 PM] Akshay: People can make bad decisions if they assume this
[2/22/18, 9:23:50 PM] Akshay: Like trump
[2/22/18, 9:24:02 PM] Akshay: Who now says teachers must have guns to prevent shootings
[2/22/18, 9:24:03 PM] Akshay: Lol
[2/22/18, 9:24:40 PM] Suyash: It shall take me a while to catch up with this chat!
[2/22/18, 9:24:54 PM] Akshay: Sorry for bringing in a serious example in a trivial joke but I'm saying that rigorous statistical analysis is needed before arriving at conclusions for those conclusions to correctly inform further courses of action.
[2/22/18, 9:26:35 PM] Sunil: Yeah that's messed up
